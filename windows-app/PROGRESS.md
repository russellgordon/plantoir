# Plantoir for Windows — Progress

What each project in the solution is, and what state the app is in. First take
built overnight 2026-08-11 by Claude Code, per
[`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`](../WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md); the assist subsystems folded
into `main` on 2026-08-14. Everything below was **verified live on the
maintainer's Windows 11 machine** (WSL2 + Ubuntu-24.04 + Docker Engine 29, no
Docker Desktop) unless marked otherwise.

## Layout

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| `Plantoir/` | The WinUI 3 app (unpackaged, self-contained Windows App SDK, PerMonitorV2 DPI). Bundles the full toolchain recipe under `Toolchain/` and mirrors it into each working folder's `.toolchain/`. |
| `Plantoir.Core/` | All logic, UI-free: config round-trip, container naming, port leases, build freshness, archiver/restorer, section adder, ConPTY process, transcript builder, script runner, milestones, question parsing, failure explainer, catalogs, workspace/toolchain services — **and the whole assist subsystem** under `Assist/` (18 files): `AssistWorkspace`, `AssistAgent`, the plans (`PublishPlan`, `ReDatePlan`, `SyncPlan`, `InsertPlan`, `NewClassesPlan`, `CurriculumMentionsPlan`), `LinkGraph`, `SectionIndex`, `Timetable` and `TimetableMemory`, `DateAudit`, `UndoHistory`, `ScheduledDeploy` and `TaskScheduling`, `Briefing`, and `WorkLease`. |
| `Plantoir.Tests/` | xUnit suite that runs **without Docker**: `dotnet test`. No count is given here on purpose — it rots. Classes touching process-wide state (preview leases, the publish registry) share a serialized collection — see `SharedActivityState`. |
| `PtyDriver/` | Console harness that drives the launchers under a ConPTY with scripted prompt replies — how the E2E runs below were performed. |
| `Plantoir.UiTests/` | Drives the REAL built app through UI Automation (FlaUI/UIA3), for what a unit test cannot reach — see "Driving the real interface" below. Opt-in: skipped unless `PLANTOIR_UI_TESTS=1`, and compiled by a SOLUTION build (not by the per-project commands used day to day). References `Plantoir.Core` only, never the app project — the Windows App SDK has no business in a test host. |
| `Plantoir.Mcp/` | On `main` (`Plantoir.sln` lists it) and **it ships**: `publish.ps1` publishes it, copies `plantoir-mcp.exe` into the app's own output beside `Plantoir.exe`, and includes it in the signing list. A standalone MCP server exposing one working folder to an AI assistant. Load-bearing at runtime — `Plantoir/Services/ClaudeCodeLauncher.cs` looks for it beside the app, and `Plantoir/Services/McpClient.cs` launches it. See [its README](Plantoir.Mcp/README.md). |

## Where parity stands (2026-09-06)

`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`'s numbered list is the index, and it was corrected on this
date after drifting in both directions — item 5 had been finished since August
with its headline still reading as open work. **Sixteen of its twenty-four
items are done**, items 21, 23 and 24 having landed on 2026-09-06 (the
folder-problems front end, the same findings reaching the assistant, and the
overnight run's findings being captured and reported the next morning).
What is genuinely left, smallest first:

| Item | What is left | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 19 | The `working-folder.txt` marker AND a sweep that reads it. Do both or neither — the marker alone is ceremony. Two Windows specifics for the sweep are written into item 19. | Small |
| 18 | The two VIEWS: the choice at the folder picker, and the dismissable notice for a folder the window restored. Detection, wording and the remembered-per-folder store are built — the store's API is `AppSettings.HasAcceptedSyncFor` / `RememberAcceptedSyncFor`, and the two moments belong in `WorkspacePickerView` (a folder just chosen) and `MainWindow`'s restore path (a folder the window reopened). | Medium |
| 17 | The app-side `course_config.json` writer and the interrupted-rename recovery. Belongs with item 13's sheet. | Medium |
| 13 | The rename SHEET, the method that performs the moves, the config keys carried across, and the materialisation of `class_folder`/`curriculum_folder`. The model layer (`FolderPathRewriter`, `SpecialFolderRenamer`) is built and has 52 test methods over 63 cases. Attach at `FormBuilders`' `protectionFor` hook, from `CourseSettingsView.xaml.cs`; the renamer exposes `Problem`, `Moves`, `WhyTheMovesCannotBeMade`, `HalfFailureMessage` and `KeysThatCarryAcross` — there is no apply/perform method yet. | Large |
| ~~22~~ | ✅ Done 2026-09-06 — the "Folders Plantoir uses" sheet, now shared as `shared-rules.json` → `specialFoldersHelp` rather than living inside a view. Two cases proposed back to the mac. | — |

Two things that are NOT in that list and should be known:

- **The deploy gate exists now.** `verify-deploy.ps1` publishes to every
  destination and every pairing against real sites and fetches each one back:
  36 passed, 0 failed on 2026-09-06. It needs credentials and the network, so
  it is opt-in and wired into nothing. Run it when the publishing path
  changes. It is the only automated check of the PowerShell half of
  publishing — `verify.sh` and `verify-deploy.sh` are bash and do not run
  here.
- **The unit suite is green**: 911 passed, 0 failed at the time this section
  was written; 945 after the folder-problems front end, and 979 once
  parity-tail was merged into it and the overnight capture was added. `dev` stood
  at 668 passed with 5 failing contract tests before this series; those five
  were each a real gap between what the contract says Windows does and what it
  did. **1,029 passed with 2 skipped** after item 29 wired the contract case
  lists this suite was not reading (2026-09-06). The two skips are named
  divergences rather than unfinished work: `use_skeleton` (item 25) and the
  frontmatter-key question the mac has to settle, each carrying the test that
  closes it.

## Every contract case list is now RUN here (2026-09-06)

WINDOWS-HANDOFF item 29. Twenty-three lists the mac suite ran and this one did
not read — none unreachable, each simply a test nobody had written.
`contracts/README.md` now names which class runs which, so the audit does not
have to be repeated.

**What matters for anyone adding to this suite** is the shape those tests
take, because the old ones were the wrong shape rather than absent:

- **Ask each list both ways.** Walking the contract and looking each case up in
  the code cannot notice a case the CODE has and the contract does not. Every
  gap item 29 found came from the reverse direction — an extra credential
  request, twelve extra MCP tools, sixteen extra tool arguments.
- **Assert completeness.** A hand-written mirror answers the cases that existed
  when somebody read the contract, and stays green when the mac adds one. Where
  cases are prose keyed to behaviour, map each to a named test by `nameof` and
  assert nothing is unmapped. Map to NAMES rather than draining a shared set:
  xUnit builds a fresh instance per `[Fact]` and fixes no order, so a set filled
  by ten tests and emptied by an eleventh passes on whatever happened to run,
  and reports nothing under `--filter`.
- **Read the source only against the thing that decides.** Several rules live in
  `Plantoir/` — the wizard, the composer, the report dialog — which this project
  does not reference. Reading their source is legitimate (`ParsingTests` does it
  for the `.ps1` launchers) but must be anchored: bare containment passed with a
  guard moved into a comment, and with it deleted from one of two arrow keys.
- **A new collection, `ProcessEnvironment`**, beside `SharedActivityState`, for
  tests that read or write process-wide environment variables. Same reason:
  `PLANTOIR_BUILD_ROOT` is global, and a class setting it while another calls
  `BuildOutputLocation.BuildsRootFor` is a rare flake that looks exactly like a
  production bug about where built sites go.

## Driving the real interface — what the table points at (2026-09-06)

The Layout table above says "see 'Driving the real interface' below" and, until
now, there was no such section: the prose lives in
[`documentation/12-windows-app.md`](../documentation/12-windows-app.md). Rather
than move it, here is what a session needs to know before running the suite,
and the one thing measurement added.

Run it **from the repository root**, not from `windows-app/`:

```powershell
.\run-ui-tests.ps1                 # all of it, about 3 minutes
.\run-ui-tests.ps1 -Filter "FullyQualifiedName~TheSheetCloses"
```

It closes a running Plantoir before it starts, says so, and does not reopen it.
`--state-dir` moves the whole state folder for the run, so nothing of the
teacher's is touched.

**One test is intermittent, and it is worth knowing which.**
`SpecialFoldersHelpUiTests.TheSheetShowsAMarksFolderTickedButNotYetSaved`
failed once in a full run on 2026-09-06 and then passed twice — once alone (30
s) and once in a full run (6/6, 3 m 16 s). It is the test that ticks a marks
folder and waits for the sheet to be rebuilt through the dispatcher, and it
already retries for 20 seconds at half-second intervals. Nothing in that run
had touched the app or the UI project.

**So: if it fails, re-run it alone before believing it.** Recorded because an
intermittent nobody writes down is rediscovered as a regression by the next
session, which then goes looking for a cause that is not there. If it starts
failing in isolation, that is different and is a real finding — the retry is
generous enough that a genuine break would not hide behind it.

## A model layer exists ahead of its UI — four types nothing calls yet (2026-09-06)

`SpecialFolderRenamer`, `FolderPathRewriter`, `CloudSyncedFolder` and
`CloudSyncWording` are built, documented and under test, and **nothing in
`windows-app/Plantoir` calls any of them.** That is deliberate, not an
oversight: items 13 and 18 were taken as far as they could go without
inventing teacher-facing wording and dialogs, so the rules landed first and
the views are what remains.

Grep for callers and you will find none — that is the expected answer, and it
is written here so nobody concludes they have missed a wiring step or deletes
the types as dead code. The same goes for the four trail events below: the
features that would raise them are these same two.

## SIX activity-trail events are declared but not yet emitted (2026-09-06; a seventh was, and now is)

`ActivityTrail.Event` names `folder renamed`, `folder created`,
`synced folder noticed`, `synced folder accepted` — and, found 2026-09-06,
`settings saved` and `settings could not be saved`, which belong to no
unbuilt view at all: `CourseSettingsView.Save_Click` writes the config and
records nothing, while the mac records both. That last pair is a small fix
rather than a feature, and it is handoff item 28. The first four are in
`contracts/shared-rules.json` → `activityTrail.mustRecord`, and
`ContractTests.SharedRules_ActivityTrailEvents_Exist` compares that list
against the enum — so declaring them is what makes the suite green.

**Nothing raises any of them yet**, because the features that would are only
half built: WINDOWS-HANDOFF item 13's rename sheet does not exist (the model
layer — `SpecialFolderRenamer`, `FolderPathRewriter` — does), and item 18's
two views do not exist (the detection and the wording do).

This is written here rather than left in a commit message because a green
suite that is green on a promise is exactly the kind of thing a later session
should be able to find. **When either feature's front end lands, the events
must actually be recorded** — the count and the names are in the contract
entries, and `ReclaimedProcesses` is the worked example of parsing something
out and putting it on the trail.

**There was a FIFTH, and this section did not name it: `folder problem
repaired`.** Declared when the trail was built, still with no call site on
2026-09-06 — it got one that day, when item 21's front end landed (`Models/
SiteHealthRepair.cs`). It is recorded here because the omission is the
interesting part: this section was written by listing the events somebody
remembered were promised, and a fifth had been dead long enough to stop being
remembered. The honest way to keep this list right is
`grep -c` per enum member, not recollection.

## The subsystems that table does not name

- **A built-in local AI assistant.** `Views/AssistWindow.xaml` holds the
  conversation, `Plantoir.Core/Assist/LocalModel.cs` runs a small model natively on
  the Windows host with Vulkan GPU acceleration (no account and no internet), and
  `Services/McpClient.cs` drives the same `plantoir-mcp` Claude Code drives — one
  tool surface, two front ends.
- **Claude Code integration.** `Services/ClaudeCodeLauncher.cs` writes
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plantoir\assist\mcp-<CODE>.json` and launches `claude` with
  `--mcp-config … --strict-mcp-config`, so a teacher's own MCP servers are
  neither used nor disturbed. Both doors sit on a course's context menu:
  **Revise with Claude…** (only when Claude Code and the server are both
  present) and **Revise with local AI assistant…**.
- **A cross-process lease protocol**, `Plantoir.Core/Assist/WorkLease.cs`.
  Four kinds — `assist`, `preview`, `publish`, `build` — as files under
  `courses/.internal/activity/`, so the app and the server can see each
  other's work. Only a *build* is exclusive; previewing during a conversation
  is the point.
- **Scheduled deploys**, `Assist/ScheduledDeploy.cs` + `TaskScheduling.cs`,
  reached from the sidebar's Schedule Deploy… and from the assistant, sharing
  one refusal path so the two cannot drift.
- **Three publishing destinations**, not one: `deploy.ps1` handles Netlify,
  Cloudflare Pages and a plain folder.
- **Folder-problem checks, surfaced in two of the three places they can
  happen.** The shared Python checks a course's folders during every build and
  prints one `PLANTOIR_HEALTH:` line per problem;
  `Plantoir.Core/Models/SiteHealthFinding.cs` parses them,
  `SiteHealthRepair.cs` puts right the two that can be put right, and
  `Views/FolderProblemsDialog.cs` shows the rest. The app's preview and
  publish are covered, and so is the assistant (`Plantoir.Mcp/
  LauncherRunner.cs` lifts findings out and `SiteHealthFinding.Appending`
  says them). **The scheduled deploy is covered too, differently**: it runs
  with the app closed, so its wrapper captures the build's output per run,
  copies the marker lines into a per-course-and-section record, and the
  section's own view reads that record the next time it is opened — consumed
  as it is read, and cleared by a clean run.

## Proven end to end

Screenshot- or exit-code-verified on real hardware: the launchers
(`setup.ps1 --install-example` built the image locally from the recipe and
installed EXC2O; `preview.ps1 EXC2O 1` served HTTP 200; `deploy.ps1 EXC2O 1`
took its token from Windows Credential Manager and put 233 files live over
https); the app itself (folder picker → sidebar → section view, with Preview
building and embedding the live site in the app's WebView2, and Deploy running
end to end in-app — "Uploading your pages… 25 of 230" at Step 7 of 8, the
count parsed from launcher output); and the wizard's answer pump against the
real `setup_course.py`, exit 0 with a full course scaffolded, using the same
`NewCourseCreator.PumpAnswers` the Create Course button uses.

## The hard-won platform lessons (do not relearn these)

1. **ConPTY std-handle hygiene.** A process whose own stdio is redirected leaks
   stale pipe handles into its pseudo-console child; `wsl.exe` then reports
   "the input device is not a TTY". A GUI app is naturally clean; test
   harnesses must get their own console (ShellExecute / `Start-Process`).
2. **ConPTY soft-wrap duplication.** Re-rendered wrapped lines arrive with the
   boundary character doubled — hence the runner's 400-column pseudo console,
   so no real line wraps.
3. **PowerShell 5.1 + `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'` + wsl stderr.** Any
   redirected call site (`*> $null`) turns wsl's stderr into terminating
   ErrorRecords; the launchers' `docker` wrapper relaxes the preference around
   the wsl call.
4. **Container-name parity.** Everything hashes the folder's PHYSICAL path
   (true on-disk casing via `GetFinalPathNameByHandle`, symlinks resolved)
   plus `"\n"`, SHA-256, first 8 hex — `FolderContainers` in Core and all
   three launchers agree byte for byte.

## Spec coverage

Tracked in one place only: the **Windows status** section of
[`GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md`](../GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md) (264 rows as of 2026-08-18,
entries 1–264 assessed). Nothing here duplicates it, because a second copy is
a copy that goes stale — that count itself had been reading "179 rows" for
days after the log passed 250.

**What to do with that assessment** is the ordered list in
[`WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`](../WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md) → "Where Windows actually
stands", written 2026-08-17 by reading this app's source from the mac. It was
read rather than run — `dotnet` is not installed there — so treat it as a
plan to start from, and report anything it gets wrong in `MAC-HANDOFF.md`.

## Known rough edges for the next session

- **The native (containerless) toolchain shipped in v1.1.0 — this is no
  longer a branch, and the container path is gone, not merely deprecated.**
  `windows-native-toolchain` merged (`b356a1fc` onward) and the WSL2/Docker
  fallback was deleted outright in `5925e102` — a copy of the app with no
  bundled runtime now fails fast with "This copy of Plantoir is missing its
  website builder. Reinstall Plantoir, then try again." (`setup.ps1`,
  `preview.ps1`, `deploy.ps1`); there is no fallback path left to take. Run
  `windows-app/Vendor/fetch-runtime.ps1` once before building — it fetches
  Node 20, Python 3.11 embeddable, patched Quartz with win-x64 node_modules,
  wrangler and the emoji font into `windows-app/Vendor/runtime/` (~600 MB,
  gitignored), which the build robocopy-mirrors beside the app. The
  launchers run natively whenever `PLANTOIR_RUNTIME` (set by `ScriptRunner`)
  or the installed app's own runtime folder exists — that is now the only
  code path. Builds land in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plantoir\builds\<folder-id>`
  (OneDrive-safe). Verified by hand, both before and after an adversarial
  pass (`abb28380`) that found and fixed six real defects (a stop sweep that
  silently did nothing, a preview-port announce race, a course-creation
  failure mode, and stale WSL2/container wording leaking into the trail and
  the UI): native build (57 s cold), serve (HTTP 200), stop (kills the tree,
  frees both ports), Netlify delta deploy — all with no container, and the
  app-driven flow end to end, including the setup wizard's keyboard path
  under ConPTY (auto-answered course creation, no ConPTY stall).
- **The WSL2 auto-install path (`Install-WindowsSubsystem`) described here
  previously is gone, not merely superseded.** It existed to provision WSL2
  + Docker on a fresh PC for the container toolchain; the native runtime
  removed that need entirely, and `Install-WindowsSubsystem` is no longer
  present in the launchers (confirmed by search — no remaining references).
  A fresh PC now needs only the .NET 9 runtime the app is self-contained
  against; there is no VM, no reboot-for-VM-platform-features case, and
  nothing here to verify.
- The toolbar can still truncate at narrow widths. The window minimum **is**
  enforced at 900×600 (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `PreferredMinimumWidth` /
  `PreferredMinimumHeight`); the opening size is not 900×600 but a share of
  the display's work area, clamped, so it looks right at any scale.
- The preview accelerators exist — Ctrl+R, Alt+Left, Alt+Right, declared at
  view scope in `Views/SectionDetailView.xaml` and handled in its code-behind.
  ~~What is missing is a **Preview menu-bar item**~~ — added 2026-08-22
  (`MainWindow.xaml`, handoff item 1). Corrected 2026-09-06: this paragraph
  outlived the work by a fortnight, and anyone planning from it would have
  built it twice.
- Two paths proven underneath but never click-driven in-app: the wizard's
  Create button (the `setup.ps1` + answer-pump path ran to completion via
  PtyDriver), and the new-site dialog a BRAND-NEW section's deploy raises —
  the verified deploy was a repeat publish to an existing site.
- Smoke-test hooks, all driving the real button code paths
  (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `RunAutomationHooks`): `--auto-select CODE N`,
  `--auto-preview CODE N`, `--auto-deploy CODE N`, `--auto-course CODE`,
  `--auto-wizard`, `--auto-createcourse CODE [SECTIONS]`,
  `--auto-addsection CODE`.
