"""
Every module a baked script imports must itself be baked into the image.

The image copies scripts one by one, by name, rather than the whole folder —
so splitting a rule out into a new sibling module is a change to the Dockerfile
whether or not anybody remembers it is. `setup_course.py` and `build_site.py`
import their siblings by BARE NAME, which resolves only if the file is sitting
beside them in `/opt/scripts`.

**This exists because it happened.** `class_pages.py` was added on 2026-09-04,
imported from both of those, and not copied. Every unit test was green and the
Docker image could not be built AT ALL: the Dockerfile imports `setup_course`
during the build to bake the Explorer's hide filter, so the missing module was
not a run-time surprise for one teacher, it was a hard failure of the build
that produces the toolchain. `verify.sh` caught it. This test makes the next
one cheaper to catch than a full image build.

The check is deliberately about IMPORTS rather than about a hand-kept list: a
list is a second place to forget.
