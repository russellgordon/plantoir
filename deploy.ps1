Usage:
  .\deploy.bat <COURSE_CODE> <SECTION_NUMBER> [--target netlify|cloudflare] [--diagnose] [--team <TEAM_SLUG>] [--to-folder <PATH>] [--reset-token|--logout] [--non-interactive]

Examples:
  .\deploy.bat ICS3U 1
  .\deploy.bat ICS3U 1 --diagnose
  .\deploy.bat ICS3U 1 --team my-org-slug
  .\deploy.bat ICS3U 1 --target cloudflare

Notes:
- Deploys from /teaching/courses/<COURSE>/.merged_output/section<SECTION> inside the container.
- You must build first (the static site goes to 'public/' in that section folder).
- --target chooses where the built site goes. netlify (the default) or cloudflare.
- The token for whichever service you publish to is stored as a Windows Generic
  Credential and injected securely at runtime. Netlify and Cloudflare tokens are
  stored separately, so using one never disturbs the other.
- A Cloudflare token needs one permission: Account - Cloudflare Pages - Edit.
  The account is discovered from the token, so there is nothing else to enter.
- Use --reset-token (or --logout) to remove the saved token and re-link on next
  run; combine it with --target cloudflare to clear the Cloudflare one instead.
- If your course code ends with '0' (zero), you'll be prompted to correct it to 'O' for Open-level courses.

  # WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE-LINER. Windows PowerShell

  # result PER FILE rather than one answer overall. A clean site of 314 pages
  # therefore comes back as a 314-element array of $null - and in PowerShell
  # a non-empty array is TRUE whatever is in it. So

  #     if ($files | Select-String -Pattern ... -List -Quiet) { ... }

  # was true whenever the site had TWO OR MORE pages, which is every real
  # site. (Exactly one page is the one case it got right, by accident: a
  # single-element array unwraps to the scalar it holds, which is falsy.)
  # The consequences were both invisible and total: every publish to a folder
  # announced "This site was built by a preview", rebuilt whether or not it
  # needed to, waited the full 30 s for a condition that could never become
  # false, and then refused with "The rebuilt site still carries the
  # preview's live-reload script. Nothing was published." Publishing to a
  # folder could not succeed on Windows, ever. Measured 2026-09-05 by
  # publishing a site whose 314 pages contained no live-reload client at all
  # and watching it be refused three times running.
  #
  # `deploy.sh` is not affected: `grep -rq` returns one exit status for the
  # whole tree, which is the answer this needs. The bug is entirely in the
  # PowerShell port of that check.
  #
  # Testing for a MatchInfo instead of a Boolean is the fix: -List stops at
  # the first match in each file, Select-Object -First 1 stops at the first
  # file, and $null -ne is an unambiguous test whatever the pipeline count.

One more thing from Cloudflare.

The token you just made is allowed to publish, but not to look up which
Cloudflare account it belongs to - so the account's ID is needed as well.
This is the only time you will be asked for it.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com
  2. Choose "Workers & Pages" from the list on the left.
  3. Find "Account ID" on the right-hand side, and copy it.

     dash.cloudflare.com/.)

Connect to Cloudflare.

Cloudflare hosts this section's website for free, and it needs to know that
the publishing is coming from you. It does that with an API token - a long
code that acts like a password made just for this app. Creating one takes
about two minutes, and you will not be asked again: it is saved securely on
this computer.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
     (Sign in if you are asked to.)
  2. Choose "Create Token", then "Create Custom Token".
  3. Name it something you will recognise later, such as "Class websites".
  4. Give it ONE permission, chosen from the three dropdowns:
     Account  ->  Cloudflare Pages  ->  Edit
  5. Under "Account Resources", choose "Include" and then your own account
     by name. A token that names no account cannot publish anything, and
     what you get back if you skip this does not mention accounts at all.
  6. Under "TTL", set the end date to after the end of your school year -
     next July is a safe choice - or leave it with no end date. An expired
     token stops your publishing working, with nothing to say why.
  7. Choose "Continue to summary", then "Create Token".
  8. Copy the long code Cloudflare shows you - it is only shown once - and
     paste it below. Nothing appears as you paste; that is normal.
