# Releasing Plantoir

**One product, one version series, one GitHub release carrying both platforms'
assets.** The product version lives in ONE place — `<Version>` in
`windows-app/Plantoir/Plantoir.csproj` — and `MARKETING_VERSION` in
`mac-app/project.yml` must say the same number. The About panels read them and
the git tag must match.

> **Which repository?** plantoir.app's download links resolve against
> `github.com/russellgordon/plantoir`, which matches `origin`. Pass
> `-R russellgordon/plantoir` explicitly to every `gh` command — a release
> published to the wrong repository leaves the site's evergreen links serving
> nothing.

## Two platforms, one version series — and when they lag

Decided 2026-08-20, the day Windows 1.1.0 was ready while the mac had no code
changes at all. The rule that resolves every case of "which number goes on
this build":

**The version number names which CONTRACTS the build passes, never "what
changed on this platform."** The two apps are coupled through
[`contracts/`](contracts/README.md): a contract vintage is part of the
version, and a teacher saying "I'm on 1.1.0" must pin down exactly one set of
sentences and rules regardless of their OS. Three consequences:

- **A platform may ship a version the other is not ready for.** The tag goes
  up carrying the ready platform's assets; GitHub releases accept assets
  added later, so the other platform's binary JOINS the same release when it
  qualifies. Until then, plantoir.app's two download buttons simply point at
  different releases — each honestly labelled. (If the catch-up work turns
  out to change behaviour, it becomes the next patch version instead, and
  the ready platform re-attaches unchanged.)

  **That labelling is not optional, it is a broken download otherwise.** Both
  cards normally use GitHub's evergreen `releases/latest/download/<asset>`
  URL, which begins resolving to the new release the instant it publishes —
  so the lagging platform's button 404s until its binary joins. Pin that card
  to the last release that has the asset, note the older version on it, and
  **un-pin it when the platform catches up**: a pinned card keeps serving an
  old version from a button that looks perfectly healthy, which is why the
  un-pinning is the half that gets forgotten. Done first for v1.1.0
  (Windows only), 2026-08-20; the procedure is in the `cut-release` skill.
- **"No code changes" does not exempt a platform from the gate.** A mac DMG
  gets the 1.1.0 label only when a mac session has made its suite green
  against the 1.1.0 contracts. An unchanged binary re-badged with a new
  number would claim contracts it was never tested against.

  **Worked example, 2026-08-20 — the gate this rule was written for, run.**
  The mac's list was: implement the teacher-made-link explainer case, retire
  the three obsolete WSL-setup cases, run `./verify.sh` against the changed
  shared scripts, and do the two verifications `MAC-HANDOFF.md` listed. All
  four came back green and **none of them required a behaviour change**, so
  the DMG joined v1.1.0 rather than becoming 1.1.1. The verifications are
  the part worth copying: both were "prove it against the real app", and
  both found something a code read alone would have got wrong — the
  assistant's warm-up race IS present on the mac (measured: 1.7 s warm
  against 3.1 s racing it) but cannot produce the failure Windows fixed, and
  the run-transcript gap that mirrors the Windows one is unreachable here
  because every task launches through `/bin/bash`. A gate that only asks
  "does it compile" would have passed both without learning either.

  **A behaviour DID change before that cut, and it did not move the number
  — here is the test that decides such cases.** Testing the candidate turned
  up the mac blocking its main thread while setting up a new working folder,
  which Windows 1.1.0 already handles properly. Ask: **does this bring the
  lagging platform UP TO the number, or does it change what the number
  means?** Windows shipped 1.1.0 with the good behaviour, so the mac lacking
  it was the mac being behind 1.1.0 — fixing it makes the two agree on what
  1.1.0 is, and 1.1.0 is still the right label. The answer would be the
  opposite for a change neither platform has shipped: that one earns the
  next number, because a teacher on Windows 1.1.0 would not have it.
- **Release notes say "macOS: no changes" (or the reverse) plainly** when a
  platform ships under a new number without behaviour changes. That sentence
  is the entire cost of keeping one series, and it is cheaper than every
  support conversation under two.

**Build numbers** exist to uniquely name BITS — the trail prints
"Plantoir 1.1.0 (build)" into problem reports, and two artifacts must never
share a name. So: derive, never hand-maintain — `git rev-list --count HEAD`
at bundle-build time — bump on every build that leaves the dev machine
(every DMG and installer, including ones handed to a tester), and never
reset the count, across marketing versions, forever.

**The mac does this in `publish.sh`**, which passes
`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION=$(git rev-list --count HEAD)` to `xcodebuild`;
`project.yml` carries `"0"` as a placeholder for local builds, and
`Info.plist` reads `$(MARKETING_VERSION)` / `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`
rather than repeating their values. **This paragraph claimed the mac
"follows this today" from the day it was written until 2026-08-20, and it
was not true**: both plist keys were the literal `1.0.0`, so every 1.0.0
build also reported build 1.0.0 and no two artifacts could be told apart.
Found while qualifying the mac for v1.1.0. The Windows bundle should adopt
the same number as its version's fourth field when convenient (its trail
currently prints the patch digit, which conflates two ideas).

## Landed since v1.1.0 — ships in the next release

Features that are **complete, merged to `dev`, and waiting only for a tag**.
This is a reading aid, not a source of truth: the release notes are drafted
from the commits since the last tag, so anything merged is carried whether or
not it is listed here. What the list buys is the thing commits do not say —
whether a teacher will notice, and whether both platforms have it.

**Clear this list when the tag goes up**, in the same commit that moves the
version line. A list that survives its own release is worse than no list.

| Landed | What a teacher sees | Platforms | Log |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-21 | Class sites carry the Plantoir icon in the browser tab, instead of Quartz's logo. Also at the site root, and as the Home Screen icon on iOS. | Both — shared Python and shared assets; no app code changed on either side. First preview after updating rebuilds the website builder once. | [298, 299](GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md) |
| 2026-09-05 | **Their working folder stops carrying the website it builds.** A folder kept in iCloud Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive no longer uploads thousands of files after every preview; Time Machine no longer backs them up; zipping a course to hand to a colleague no longer packs them in; and Get Info stops counting them. Nothing a teacher wrote moves — only the built site, which is rebuilt on demand anyway. A real course folder went from 87 MB to 73 MB. One sentence about synced folders also leaves the app, because it is no longer true. | **macOS only** — Windows has kept built websites outside the working folder since row 290, so nothing changes for a Windows teacher except that one retired sentence. First preview after updating rebuilds the website builder once, as any toolchain change does. **⚠️ Carries a required warning — see "Warnings the release notes MUST carry" below.** | [402–406](GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md) |

## Warnings the release notes MUST carry

Separate from the table above, and it has to be: that table is for what a
teacher gains, and this is for what they must DO — the sentences a teacher has
to read before updating, not after. The notes are drafted from the commits, and
a caution buried in a commit body is a caution that gets summarised away.

Same rule as the table: **clear this list when the tag goes up**, in the same
commit that moves the version line.

| Added | The warning | Why it cannot be left out |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-05 | **If you keep your working folder in iCloud Drive (or Dropbox, or OneDrive) and use it on TWO Macs, update both of them.** A Mac still on the older version will not be able to build a course the newer one has touched, and will quietly undo the newer one's setup each time it opens the folder. | The mac now keeps built websites outside the working folder, and leaves a shortcut behind in their place (rows 402–406). That shortcut syncs. An older `build_site.py` cannot repair one that points somewhere it cannot see — it stops with "File exists", which reads as nonsense — and no version shipped before 2026-09-05 can be taught to. It is worse than one stale machine failing on its own, because the launchers and `.toolchain/` live INSIDE the synced folder: an older app refreshes them back to its own copies, and a publish scheduled on the up-to-date Mac then runs whatever it finds there. **Before this change a version mismatch between two Macs was harmless**, which is exactly why nobody will expect it. Merged to `dev` 2026-09-05, so it ships with the next tag. Reasoning: `contracts/shared-rules.json` → `buildOutputLocation.syncedFoldersFollowTheLink.aSecondMacMustBeUPDATED`; implementer's version in `WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md`. |

## The short version

For future-you, mid-school-year, who remembers nothing. The whys are below.

1. **Everything merged and green?** Both sides on `main`; `dotnet test` passes
   in `windows-app/`; the mac unit suite passes. Then **actually publish a
   section from an app** — see step 2 for why that is not optional.
2. **Check the version** in `windows-app/Plantoir/Plantoir.csproj` and
   `mac-app/project.yml`; they must match each other and the tag you are about
   to cut.
3. **Build the signed Windows bundle**: `az login`, then
   `cd windows-app; powershell -File publish.ps1 -Sign`. It fails fast with the
   remedy if anything is missing. Output lands in `windows-app\dist\PlantoirSetup.exe`
   (and `Plantoir-win-x64.zip`).
4. **Build the signed & notarized macOS bundle**:
   `cd mac-app; ./publish.sh -Sign`. Output lands in `mac-app/dist/Plantoir-macOS.dmg`.
5. **Tell Claude "cut the release."** It drafts teacher-friendly notes, adds the
   SHA-256 table, creates the GitHub Draft Release, uploads the assets, publishes
   the release, updates the site's version line, redraws the brand images, and pushes to `main`.

## The checklist, with the reasons

1. **Version.** `<Version>` in `windows-app/Plantoir/Plantoir.csproj` and
   `MARKETING_VERSION` in `mac-app/project.yml`. `project.yml` is the source on
   the mac side, so re-run `xcodegen generate` after changing it.
2. **Full test pass**: `dotnet test Plantoir.Tests` and the mac unit suite, plus
   a hand smoke of create → preview → publish on a real course.

   > The hand smoke is **not optional, and not a formality**. The bundle carries
   > the whole toolchain recipe (Dockerfile, `scripts/`, `patches/`, `contracts/`,
   > launchers)
   > inside the app, and the xUnit suite deliberately never touches Docker — so
   > a green test run says nothing about the thing teachers actually run.
   > `verify.sh`, the real toolchain gate, is bash and expects `docker` on
   > `PATH`, which does not hold on Windows where Docker Engine lives in WSL2.
   > **On Windows the hand smoke is the only DOCKER verification there is.**
   > (It is no longer the only toolchain verification: since 2026-09-07
   > `PythonToolchainTests` runs all fifteen shared `scripts/test_*.py` files
   > inside `dotnet test` — the same files `verify.sh` runs on the mac, which
   > nothing ran here before. They need no Docker, so they cover the shared
   > Python and say nothing about the image.)

   **If the release changes anything under `scripts/`, the Dockerfile or a
   launcher, run the publishing verifier rather than smoking it by hand** —
   `verify-deploy.ps1` on Windows, `./verify-deploy.sh` on the mac. It is the
   automation this step used to ask for in prose: it publishes to all three
   destinations (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, a folder — different code paths
   each) and every pairing, then FETCHES EACH SITE BACK and reads it, which is
   the only way to catch the two failures that have actually shipped here — a
   preview build reaching a published site, and a publish that reported success
   having copied the wrong thing or nothing.

   > **Require a run with nothing skipped.** A destination with no credentials
   > on the machine is skipped and the run still exits 0 — correct for everyday
   > use, wrong for a release. Read the summary line: `passed, failed, skipped`.
   > A cut is the moment "Cloudflare was skipped on that laptop" stops being
   > acceptable, so get the credentials on the machine and run it again.
   >
   > It needs three credentials, the network and about twenty minutes, and it
   > **creates real, globally unique sites that nothing deletes** — so no suite
   > runs it and none should. Delete the sites it made when you are done.
3. **Build the signed Windows bundle**:

       powershell -File publish.ps1 -Sign

   One-time tooling on a new machine (the Azure account/identity setup itself
   lives in the private Artifact Signing runbook):

       winget install --exact --id Microsoft.AzureCLI   # then open a NEW terminal
       dotnet tool install --global sign --prerelease
       winget install --exact --id JRSoftware.InnoSetup

   Per session: a plain `az login` as azure@russellgordon.ca — that user holds
   the "Artifact Signing Certificate Profile Signer" role on the
   `plantoir-signing` account directly (granted 2026-08-19), so no
   service-principal secret is involved. (The `plantoir-signing` app
   registration still exists and also holds the role, but the release flow no
   longer needs its secret.) The script preflights the tools and login, signs
   the binaries, compiles `installer.iss`, and signs `dist\PlantoirSetup.exe`
   with an RFC 3161 timestamp.

   Output: **`dist/PlantoirSetup.exe`** (and portable `dist/Plantoir-win-x64.zip`) + SHA-256.

4. **Build the signed macOS bundle**:

       ./publish.sh -Sign

   One-time tooling on the Mac:
   - Developer ID Application certificate installed in Keychain Access
   - Credentials stored in notarytool: `xcrun notarytool store-credentials "notarytool-profile" --apple-id <email> --team-id <team-id> --password <app-specific-password>`

   The script builds Release, signs dylibs and executables bottom-up with Hardened Runtime,
   creates a drag-and-drop DMG, signs the DMG, notarizes with Apple, staples the ticket,
   and verifies Gatekeeper acceptance.

   Output: **`mac-app/dist/Plantoir-macOS.dmg`** + SHA-256.

5. **Tag and release** — ask Claude to "cut the release". Since the branch
   model arrived (CLAUDE.md rule 6), a release starts by merging `dev` into
   `main`: the tag points at `main`, and the website commit the flow makes
   lands there too, so finish by merging `main` back into `dev`. The
   `cut-release` skill (`.claude/skills/cut-release/`) drafts teacher-friendly notes, computes
   SHA-256 hashes, creates a GitHub Draft Release, uploads the assets, publishes
   the release, updates `website/site.json`, redraws the brand card, rebuilds `site/`,
   and pushes to `main`.

   **The Windows binaries' signatures can be verified from the Mac** — no need
   to take "it's signed" on faith when the files arrive by hand. `brew install
   osslsigncode`, fetch Microsoft's root (`curl -sL "https://www.microsoft.com/
   pkiops/certs/Microsoft%20Identity%20Verification%20Root%20Certificate%20
   Authority%202020.crt"`, convert with `openssl x509 -inform DER`), then
   `osslsigncode verify -CAfile ms-root.pem -TSA-CAfile ms-root.pem
   PlantoirSetup.exe` and expect `Signature verification: ok`. Without the
   `-CAfile` flags it reports "failed" for a perfectly good signature, because
   the Mac has no Windows root store — the failure reason to read for is a
   missing issuer, not a bad digest. Azure Trusted Signing certs live ~3 days,
   so verify the timestamp line too (proven first on v1.0.0, 2026-08-19).

   Relatedly, `brand_images.py` output is deterministic in PIXELS but not in
   BYTES: a Pillow/zlib version shift re-encodes identical images into
   different files. If the release run shows the brand PNGs modified, compare
   pixels (`PIL.ImageChops.difference(...).getbbox()` is `None` when
   identical) before treating it as a real change — pixel-identical churn
   should be checked out, not committed (hit on v1.0.0).

   **Asset names are LOAD-BEARING and must never change**:
   `PlantoirSetup.exe` and `Plantoir-macOS.dmg`. plantoir.app's download cards point at
   `releases/latest/download/<asset-name>` — GitHub's evergreen URL that serves
   the newest release's asset, so teachers click Windows or macOS and get the
   file, no GitHub in sight.

6. **Deploy plantoir.app deliberately**: `python3 website/build.py --deploy`
   builds `site/` and publishes it to Netlify (delta upload; the token comes
   from the `containerized-quartz-netlify` Keychain item, the site id from
   `website/site.json`). The Netlify site is NOT connected to GitHub —
   pushing this repository deploys nothing, which is why this step exists.

## Bundle format

- **macOS**: A styled drag-and-drop disk image (`Plantoir-macOS.dmg`) containing `Plantoir.app` and an `/Applications` shortcut. The DMG is code-signed, notarized by Apple, and stapled with its ticket for offline Gatekeeper verification.
- **Windows**: An Inno Setup installer (`PlantoirSetup.exe`) configured for `PrivilegesRequired=lowest` (per-user installation to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Plantoir`, requiring zero administrator rights). A portable zip (`Plantoir-win-x64.zip`) is also emitted.

## Brand images

Everything that carries the Plantoir mark — the `og:image` served at
plantoir.app, the Bluesky and Instagram profile photos, the Bluesky
banner — is drawn by one script from one source:

    python scripts/brand_images.py --install-card

It reads the artwork straight out of `mac-app/Plantoir.icon` (the same
bundle Icon Composer edits) and the palette out of the constants at the
top of the script, which mirror the CSS custom properties in
`site/index.html`. The four images land in `brand/`; `--install-card`
additionally copies the card to `site/social-card.png`, which Netlify
serves as the `og:image`. Nothing is fetched at run time; the Poppins
weights it needs are committed in `support/fonts/`.

**Cutting a release runs this** (step 6), and that is safe because the
output is **deterministic** — identical inputs give byte-identical PNGs.
A release that changed nothing about the artwork leaves the working tree
clean and there is nothing to commit. A diff appears only when the icon,
the palette or the tagline actually moved, which is exactly when you want
to notice. So: if `git status` is quiet after this step, that is the
expected result, not a sign it failed.

If it *does* produce a diff, look at the images before committing them —
the push deploys the card to a public URL.

Two things worth knowing about the card in particular:

- The original card was hand-made and has no source. The generated one
  is measured to match it — tile 260&nbsp;px at 108,185; wordmark Poppins
  **Medium 96**&nbsp;px; tagline Regular 33&nbsp;px on a 46&nbsp;px
  leading; domain line Medium 26&nbsp;px; rule 8&nbsp;px — and every text
  element now matches the original's ink coverage exactly. It is still
  **not** byte-identical: glyph advance widths accumulate slightly
  differently, so letters drift a pixel or two toward the end of a line.
  Background and rule are pixel-identical. Look at both before you commit.

  The brand uses Poppins **Regular and Medium only — no SemiBold**. That
  is measured from the original card, not assumed. Do not "correct" it to
  600 because `website/assets/style.css` sets `h1 { font-weight: 600 }`; the card
  is a separate artifact and was not rendered from that stylesheet.
- That file is public and every social platform that has scraped
  plantoir.app has it cached. Replacing it is an outward-facing change,
  not a refactor. Platforms re-scrape on their own schedule, so the old
  card can keep appearing in link previews for a while after deploy.

The two greens are not interchangeable and both appear on the card:
`--green-deep` (#2D6620) sets the wordmark, `--green` (#3E8C26) sets the
rule, the link, and the mark itself. The mark reads #3E8D26 rather than
the pure green in `icon.json` because the layer's translucency blends it
into the background — a rendering behaviour that cannot be recovered
from the JSON, so it is pinned as a constant in the script.

## Notes

- The PRI249 "Invalid qualifier: SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL LEARNING SKILLS"
  warning during publish is noise: the resource indexer misreads an
  example-content filename as a language qualifier. Harmless.
- GitHub's asset size limit (2 GB) is nowhere near a concern.
- With a valid Artifact Signing signature + timestamp, SmartScreen
  warnings fade as reputation accrues to the signing identity; the
  "Unblock" instructions on plantoir.app can be softened after the first
  signed release proves out on a fresh machine.
