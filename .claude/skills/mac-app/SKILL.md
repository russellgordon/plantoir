description: Working on the macOS app (mac-app/) — build it so Russell can run it on this Mac, and tell him exactly what he must do to see the change (clean build, new course, new working folder, or nothing). Use for any change under mac-app/, and for toolchain changes the app carries.

# Iterating on the macOS app

Russell tests by **running the app on this Mac**, not by reading a diff and
not inside Xcode's test runner. So a change is not delivered until the app is
built and he has been told, in one line, what he has to do to see it.

**Standing order, 2026-08-22 — supersedes everything below about launching.**
Russell has turned "Keep in Dock" on for Plantoir, so the app lives in his
Dock permanently now. That changes the delivery mechanism entirely:

- **Never launch it for him — not even if he asks you to.** This is
  stronger than the old "leave it quit" default, which still had an
  explicit exception for "he asked you to run it." That exception is
  GONE. `open` steals focus from whatever he's doing, which was always the
  reason not to relaunch unprompted — now it's the reason not to launch AT
  ALL, because there's a better way: he clicks the SAME Dock icon he
  already has, whenever he's ready.
- **Instead, always make sure that Dock icon points at what you just
  built.** See "Keep the Dock icon linked" below — most of the time this
  needs no action, since `xcodebuild` keeps writing to the same
  DerivedData path across ordinary rebuilds, but verify rather than
  assume: it has silently drifted before.
- **It's fine to force-quit a running copy while iterating, without
  asking.** Russell settled this directly, 2026-08-22: "It's OK to close
  Plantoir out from under my feet while we are iterating on a feature."
  This replaces the earlier caution about a copy he might be actively
  using — a `quit app "Plantoir"` that comes back "User canceled" (a sheet
  is blocking a graceful quit) can be followed by
  `pkill -f "Plantoir.app/Contents/MacOS/Plantoir"` without hesitating or
  asking first.

Two conditions still hold regardless:

- **Only quit into a build that SUCCEEDED**, with the bundle confirmed
  present. Quitting his last working copy to replace it with nothing is
  still the one genuinely damaging move available here.
- **Say what quitting discarded, if it plausibly did.** A conversation's
  undo history dies with its window, an unsaved settings form is lost, and a
  running preview stops. If he had an assistant window open, a single line
  — "the open conversation's undo history went with it" — is the whole of
  what is owed.

## Keep the Dock icon linked

The Dock's "persistent-apps" entry for Plantoir carries an exact path
(`_CFURLString`, plus a `book` bookmark blob Finder can fall back to). As
long as that path matches wherever `xcodebuild` just wrote the app, the
Dock icon opens today's build with no action from you. It stops matching
only when Xcode starts writing to a DIFFERENT DerivedData folder — which
does happen: **three** coexisted on this Mac as of 2026-08-22
(`Plantoir-bkxkcvxkinauqaehkgqfmwlzvsgj`, `-gxelrpkcqxwjneexjwsrbamdmvmm`,
`-bzuacszrcleopbgiavzdpqasfyky`, the oldest from 2026-08-10). A stale link
is a SILENT failure — Russell clicks the Dock, believes he's testing
today's fix, and is actually looking at a build from days ago.

**After every build, confirm the Dock target matches the newest build**, by
dylib modification time (never a bare `head -1` on a glob — see the
resolution snippet used throughout this file, e.g. in "When a clean build
is required" below):

```bash
APP=$(for a in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Plantoir-*/Build/Products/Debug/Plantoir.app; do
  d="$a/Contents/MacOS/Plantoir.debug.dylib"
  [ -f "$d" ] && echo "$(stat -f '%m' "$d") $a"
done | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
DOCK_TARGET=$(defaults read com.apple.dock persistent-apps 2>/dev/null | python3 -c '
import sys, re
text = sys.stdin.read()
m = re.search(r"ca\.russellgordon\.Plantoir.*?_CFURLString\"\s*=\s*\"(file://[^\"]+)\"", text, re.S)
print(m.group(1) if m else "NONE")
')
if [ "$DOCK_TARGET" = "file://${APP}/" ]; then
  echo "Dock already linked to the newest build."
else
  echo "MISMATCH — relink needed (see below)."
fi
```

**If it mismatches, relink it** — but do not hand-edit
`~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist` directly: `cfprefsd` caches the
domain in memory and can silently overwrite a raw file edit on its own next
write. Go through `defaults import` on the WHOLE `com.apple.dock` domain
instead, changing only the Plantoir entry, and regenerate its `book`
bookmark data properly rather than leaving it stale — Finder can fall back
to the bookmark even after `_CFURLString` is corrected, so a half-fixed
entry can still open the old build:

```bash
NEW_URL="file://${APP}/"

swift - "$APP" <<'SWIFT' > /tmp/plantoir_dock_bookmark.bin
import Foundation
let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[1])
let data = try! url.bookmarkData(options: [], includingResourceValuesForKeys: nil, relativeTo: nil)
FileHandle.standardOutput.write(data)
SWIFT

defaults export com.apple.dock /tmp/dock.plist

python3 - "$NEW_URL" <<'PY'
import plistlib, sys
new_url = sys.argv[1]
with open('/tmp/dock.plist', 'rb') as f:
    dock = plistlib.load(f)
with open('/tmp/plantoir_dock_bookmark.bin', 'rb') as f:
    bookmark = f.read()
found = False
for entry in dock.get('persistent-apps', []):
    td = entry.get('tile-data', {})
    if td.get('bundle-identifier') == 'ca.russellgordon.Plantoir':
        td['file-data']['_CFURLString'] = new_url
        td['book'] = bookmark
        found = True
if not found:
    sys.exit("Plantoir entry not found in Dock — stop, ask Russell rather than adding one")
with open('/tmp/dock_fixed.plist', 'wb') as f:
    plistlib.dump(dock, f)
PY

defaults import com.apple.dock /tmp/dock_fixed.plist
killall Dock
```

`killall Dock` is safe (the Dock restarts immediately and keeps its
entries — already noted below for the icon-cache case) but say that you did
it, since the screen flickers. **Read the entry back afterward** to confirm
the relink actually took, the same way any other change here is verified
rather than assumed:

```bash
defaults read com.apple.dock persistent-apps | grep -A3 -i plantoir
```

This has not needed to fire yet in practice (the Dock was still correctly
linked the one time this was checked, 2026-08-22) — treat the relink
script with the same care as anything else that writes to a user's real
system preferences: confirm the match check is genuinely a mismatch before
running it, and read the result back rather than trusting the script
silently.

## Every iteration ends the same way

1. **Build it.**
   ```bash
   cd mac-app && xcodegen generate && \
     xcodebuild -project Plantoir.xcodeproj -scheme Plantoir \
       -destination 'platform=macOS' build
   ```
   `xcodegen` first, always: the project file is generated and NOT committed,
   so a new file exists for the compiler only after it runs.

2. **Run the unit tests**, which are fast and worth having every time:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project Plantoir.xcodeproj -scheme Plantoir \
     -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:QuartzTeachersTests test
   ```

3. **Check the bundle exists, leave the app quit, and confirm the Dock link.**

   ```bash
   # Resolved by dylib mtime, not alphabetically — see "Keep the Dock icon
   # linked" above for why a plain `head -1` isn't safe here either.
   APP=$(for a in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Plantoir-*/Build/Products/Debug/Plantoir.app; do
     d="$a/Contents/MacOS/Plantoir.debug.dylib"
     [ -f "$d" ] && echo "$(stat -f '%m' "$d") $a"
   done | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
   [ -d "$APP" ] || { echo "NOT BUILT — stop; do not quit his running copy"; exit 1; }
   osascript -e 'quit app "Plantoir"' 2>/dev/null
   ```

   **Never quit without checking the bundle exists.** A clean DELETES it (see
   below), and quitting his working copy to replace it with nothing is the one
   genuinely damaging move available here.

   **Never `open` it afterwards** — see "Keep the Dock icon linked" above,
   the standing order as of 2026-08-22. Instead, verify the Dock's Plantoir
   entry still points at `$APP` (same section), relinking it only if it has
   drifted.

**If you drove the interface to check the change** — activating the app,
sending keystrokes, taking screenshots — bring the terminal back to the front
when that stretch is done, and put back anything the test borrowed (system
appearance, another app's state). Rule 9 in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md)
says why. (It was numbered 7 when this was written; the list has grown since.)

**And rebuild before you report back.** Rule 10 there: the moment you believe
the change addresses what was asked is the moment Russell goes to test it, and
his Dock icon opens whatever was last built. A plain `build` has to be the LAST
build of the session — `xcodebuild test` leaves a test-host bundle behind and
terminates any running copy, so testing after building undoes it.

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm" to activate'
```

The one-line summary is the part that saves him time. It is one of:

> Rebuilt and quit — launch it from the Dock; nothing else needed.
> Rebuilt and quit — you will need a NEW COURSE (code XYZ) to see this.
> Rebuilt and quit — you will need a NEW WORKING FOLDER to see this.
> Rebuilt and quit — note the open conversation's undo history went with it.

## Leave no zombie containers behind

**Check this at the end of every session that previewed, deployed or ran
`verify.sh`.** Each working folder gets its own container, named
`teaching-quartz-<hash of the folder path>`, and they are STOPPED rather than
removed when the app quits. They accumulate silently: a count of **75** had
built up by 2026-08-20, one per working folder ever previewed, going back
months. Nothing breaks — a stopped container costs only disk — but it hides
the one container that matters when you are debugging, and `docker ps -a`
becomes unreadable.

```bash
docker ps -a --filter status=exited --filter status=created \
  --format '{{.Names}}' | grep '^teaching-quartz-' | xargs -r docker rm -f
```

Three conditions, and they matter more than the cleanup does:

- **Only STOPPED ones.** A running `teaching-quartz-*` is a live preview —
  possibly Russell's, possibly another agent's in a second window. The
  filters above are what keep it safe; do not simplify them to a bare
  `docker ps -aq`.
- **Only `teaching-quartz-*`.** Colima is shared with his other projects
  (Supabase local dev, among others) — `docker system prune` is the wrong
  tool here and would take those with it.
- **Never `colima stop`**, which is rule 7 in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md)
  and unchanged by any of this.

The next `setup.sh` or `preview.sh` in a folder recreates its container
automatically, so removing one costs a teacher nothing and costs you a few
seconds of container start on the next preview. Say how many you removed —
if the number is large, that is worth him knowing.

## When a clean build is required

A plain rebuild misses some things, and the symptom is always the same:
your change is definitely in the source and definitely not in the app.

Clean when you have changed:

- **`project.yml`** — build settings, or which files are bundled.
- **anything inside a FOLDER-REFERENCE resource.** `Vendor/llama` is copied
  as a whole folder (`type: folder`), and Xcode does not notice when its
  CONTENTS change. Re-running `Vendor/fetch-llama.sh` and rebuilding gets you
  the old binaries.
- **bundled toolchain files** the app carries — `../scripts`, `../support`,
  `../patches`, `../Dockerfile`, the launchers in all three forms (`../*.sh`,
  `../*.bat`, `../*.ps1` — setup, preview and deploy of each), and the two
  individually named `../support/*.json` files (`colour_schemes.json`,
  `ontario_secondary_courses.json`). These are resources; a stale copy in the
  bundle is a very confusing hour.

**A clean DELETES the built app, so never stop halfway.** Verified: after
`xcodebuild clean` the `.app` is gone from `Build/Products/Debug/` while the
DerivedData folder and its hash survive. The Dock entry therefore still points
at the right PATH, but at nothing — and if he clicks it in that window, macOS
can turn the entry into a "?" and drop it. So clean and rebuild in ONE
command, and check the bundle is back before saying a word:

```bash
cd mac-app && xcodebuild -project Plantoir.xcodeproj -scheme Plantoir clean && \
  xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -project Plantoir.xcodeproj -scheme Plantoir \
    -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

**After a clean, the Dock icon goes blank even once the app is back.** The
bundle is fine — it carries `Assets.car`, `Plantoir.icns`, and both
`CFBundleIconName` and `CFBundleIconFile` — but macOS cached "nothing there"
while the app was missing, and rebuilding does not invalidate that cache. Fix
it as part of the clean rather than leaving him with an unlabelled square:

```bash
APP=$(for a in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Plantoir-*/Build/Products/Debug/Plantoir.app; do
  d="$a/Contents/MacOS/Plantoir.debug.dylib"
  [ -f "$d" ] && echo "$(stat -f '%m' "$d") $a"
done | sort -rn | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
touch "$APP"
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -f "$APP"
killall Dock
```

`killall Dock` is safe — the Dock restarts immediately and keeps its entries —
but say that you did it, because the screen flickers.

If that still misbehaves, removing the project's whole DerivedData folder is
the last resort, and it is a bigger deal than a clean: the folder name carries
a per-project hash (`Plantoir-bzuacszrcleopbgiavzdpqasfyky`) and Xcode
generates a NEW one, so the path itself changes and the Dock entry is left
pointing somewhere that will never exist again. A clean is recoverable by
rebuilding; this is not. **Ask first**, and afterwards he has to drag the
freshly built app back to the Dock. To see where the entry currently points:

```bash
# The path the Dock entry currently opens
defaults read com.apple.dock persistent-apps \
  | grep -A3 -i '_CFURLString.*plantoir'
```

## When he needs a NEW COURSE

Anything installed **at course creation** only reaches a course made
afterwards. An existing course keeps the shape it was born with.

Tell him to make a new course when you changed:

- **`support/example_content/<CODE>/`** — the payload is poured in at
  creation. Name the CODE he should use, because only that code shows it.
- **`support/skeletons/`** — same, but for any code with no payload; name a
  code that has none (e.g. `AVI2O`).
- **`scripts/setup_course.py`** — folders, per-section files, sentinels,
  dates, anything the installer writes.
- **new `course_config.json` keys written by the wizard.** Alternatively he
  can hand-edit the JSON of a course he already has, which is quicker — offer
  that if it is one key.

He does NOT need a new course for:

- **`scripts/build_site.py`** — that runs at every build, so previewing an
  existing course shows it.
- **the assistant, the sidebar, settings, deploys, previews** — all read the
  course as it is.

## When he needs a NEW WORKING FOLDER

Rarely, and it is worth being sure before asking — it means recreating
courses. The launchers and `.toolchain/` are **refreshed automatically** in
any folder the app opens (`refreshLaunchersIfNeeded` / `refreshToolchain`),
so changing a `.sh` or the image recipe does **not** need one.

Only ask for a new folder when testing:

- **first-run adoption** — the picker, initialising an empty folder, what a
  brand-new folder gets.
- **per-folder behaviour itself** — container naming, the port block, two
  folders open at once.

## Other state that hides a change

Ordinary rebuilding does not clear these. Clear them yourself and say so.

| Changed | Clear |
|---|---|
| Model tier, download URL or size | `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Plantoir/models` — otherwise the OLD weights are found and the new tier never downloads |
| Plan mode's "stop asking" answer | `defaults delete ca.russellgordon.Plantoir AssistPlanModeTurnedOff` |
| Scheduled deploys | `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/ca.russellgordon.Plantoir.deploy.<CODE>.section<N>` and delete the plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` |
| Colima's CPU/RAM sizing | Sizing applies when the VM is CREATED, or on a start while it is stopped. `colima stop` then start, or `colima delete` for a clean one. **Ask first** — it is shared with his other toolchains |
| The Docker image | Rebuilt automatically when the recipe hash changes. `./verify.sh` forces the whole path |

## Running the tests without chasing ghosts

- **UI tests need the machine to themselves.** Two `xcodebuild test` runs at
  once make the harness see two app processes and fail with
  "Root elements for target … should be equal". If agents are running builds,
  wait for them. Run UI tests alone:
  `-only-testing:QuartzTeachersUITests`.
- **A stray preview server fails the preview tests.** `python3 -m http.server
  8081` left over from earlier work holds the port; `pkill -f "http.server"`.
- **`verify.sh` needs a terminal**: `script -q /dev/null ./verify.sh`.
- Do not report a UI-test failure as real until it has been run alone on a
  quiet machine. That mistake has been made here before.

## Every macOS improvement is written up for Windows, as you go

**Standing rule, not a courtesy.** The Windows app is being built from what
this side learns, by somebody who cannot see the macOS code or watch it being
tested. A change that only exists in Swift is a change they will re-derive
from scratch, usually badly, and usually after shipping the same bug once.

So a macOS change is not finished until BOTH of these are true:

1. **`GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md` has an entry, and its "Notes for Windows port"
   column actually says something.** That column is not optional. Every one
   of the entries so far has one. Useful notes say what Windows must do
   differently, what it can inherit unchanged, and — most valuable — the trap
   that would look correct in review. "Shared Python, nothing to mirror" is a
   fine note when true; an empty cell never is.
2. **Anything architectural also gets a section in the `documentation/` page
   that owns its subject.** A
   log row records a decision; the deep dive explains it well enough to
   implement. Rule of thumb: if you needed more than a sentence of reasoning
   to get it right, they will too.

**Corrections count as improvements.** When a change makes existing Windows
guidance WRONG, fixing that guidance is part of the change. This has already
bitten twice in one night: the write-up still told Windows "the visible verb
is Publish, never Deploy" long after rows 140 and 143 reversed it, and the
per-conversation backup rule silently invalidated the pruning advice above
it. Stale guidance is worse than none — they will follow it.

**Say what you measured, not just what you decided.** Numbers travel; taste
does not. "The 3B inverts polarity 9 times in 10" is something they can act
on. "We chose the 4B" is not.

**Write down the REASONING, not only the behaviour — and do it as you go.**
This is the part that is always skipped and always the most expensive to
lose. A behaviour can be read off the code; the reason it is that way cannot,
and **a rule whose reason has been lost gets "simplified" back out by the
next person who reads it.** Everything below was learned the hard way and
would look like clutter to somebody who did not know why:

- why the tools are coarse (the 8-of-8-wrong / 8-of-8-right result);
- why publish and unpublish are separate verbs and the surface has no
  booleans (a boolean inverted polarity on a real model);
- why unpublish's linked-page rule is NOT the mirror of publish's;
- why some phrasings are matched in code and never reach the model;
- why the model's tool list is shorter than the server's;
- why there is no delete tool at all.

So: when a decision has a reason that is not obvious from reading the code,
the reason goes in the `documentation/` page that owns it, in the same change that makes the
decision. Not afterwards, not in a batch, and **not only when Russell asks —
he has said plainly that he will forget to, and it is not his job to
remember.** Record the roads NOT taken too, and why: an option rejected for
a good reason will otherwise be proposed again, considered afresh, and cost
the same afternoon twice.

Design conversations count as work. If a decision was reached by talking it
through rather than by writing code, it still gets written down before the
conversation moves on — that reasoning exists only in the conversation, and
conversations are the thing that gets summarised away.

## The interface never names the machinery

The oldest rule in this project, and the assistant broke it: no "toolchain",
"script", "Docker", "container", "WSL" — and **no model names**. A download
sheet reading "Plantoir picked Qwen3 4B to suit this Mac's memory" tells a
teacher nothing they can act on and quite a lot about plumbing they never
asked about.

Say **"the small assistant"** and **"the larger assistant"**. That is what
`AssistModelTier.displayName` returns, and it is the only thing shown; the
real model lives in `fileName` and `downloadURL`, which a teacher never sees.
A test (`testWhatTheTeacherIsShownNamesNoModel`) fails if a model name, a
parameter count or a file format reaches that string.

The same goes for anything else the assistant surfaces: tokens, context
windows, quantisation, Metal, GPU layers, inference. If a sentence would only
make sense to somebody who has read the source, it is not ready to show.

Two exceptions, both non-teacher-facing: `GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md` and the
write-ups record what was measured and must name models precisely, and code
comments should too. The rule is about what appears on screen.

## Open investigations — read these before touching the area

- **The preview showing stale content**:
  [`research/preview-staleness/FINDINGS.md`](../../../research/preview-staleness/FINDINGS.md).
  Several fixes have landed and the symptom was still reported afterwards.
  The live-reload suspicion recorded there was TESTED on 2026-08-15 and the
  hoped-for simplification is off the table: the websocket port mismatch is
  real, but live reload is dead anyway because file events from Mac-side
  writes never cross the Colima bind mount — the watcher inside the
  container sees nothing when Obsidian or the assistant writes a file. The
  timing machinery in `waitForPreviewServer` is therefore LOAD-BEARING; do
  not delete it in favour of live reload. The document's closing section
  lists the four changes that would all be needed before live reload could
  take over.

  Two traps recorded there that cost hours: a request's cache policy covers
  only the main request, so a single-page app can still assemble a stale page
  from cached parts; and the build happens inside the Linux VM, whose clock is
  its own, so "is this file newer than now?" is not a question worth asking —
  wait for the value to CHANGE instead.

## Things that are easy to get wrong

- **`Vendor/llama` is not committed.** A fresh clone must run
  `mac-app/Vendor/fetch-llama.sh` once or the assistant reports its engine is
  missing. The app still builds and runs without it.
- **The assistant's model is not bundled** — it downloads to Application
  Support on first use. Changing the tier means the old file is still there
  under its own name; see the table above.
- **A conversation's undo dies with its window**, and Restore only reaches
  back to the start of that conversation. When asking him to test either, say
  which window to keep open.
- **Every measurement in the assistant's documentation came from this
  48 GB M4 Pro.** Anything about memory pressure on an 8 GB Mac is unverified
  — say so rather than implying it was tested.
