        happened, with links to the pages it used, then a short list of things
        to do before next time. Nothing is explained here — the links do that.

        \(plural) created for you, dated to the days this class actually meets.
        Rename them, add more, delete the ones you do not need. The `created:`
        date is what puts them in order under All Classes, so a new page needs
        one of its own.
