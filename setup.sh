Usage: ${SELF_CMD} [options] [-- <args passed to setup_course.py>]

Options:
  --image REF          Use a specific already-built image instead of building
                       from this folder's recipe (used by verify.sh).
  --context NAME       Use a specific Docker context (sets DOCKER_CONTEXT=NAME for this run).
  --no-backup          (Pass-through to setup_course.py) Skip creating a backup ZIP — you will be asked to confirm.
  --help               Show this help and exit.

Notes:
- The website builder image is built LOCALLY from this folder's recipe
  (.toolchain/, or the Dockerfile in a repository copy). The image tag is a
  hash of the recipe, so an updated recipe rebuilds automatically. The first
  build needs an internet connection and takes a few minutes; after that it
  is cached.
- Any arguments after a literal “--” are forwarded directly to setup_course.py.

Examples:
  ${SELF_CMD}
  ${SELF_CMD} --image quartz-teacher:dev-test
  ${SELF_CMD} -- --no-backup

# >>> BUILD OUTPUT BLOCK >>> — identical in setup.sh, preview.sh and
# deploy.sh, and extracted between these two markers by
# scripts/test_build_output_link.sh, which runs the real thing against the
# states an existing teacher's folder can be in. Keep the markers, and keep
# the three copies the same.
# ---- Built websites live OUTSIDE this folder -------------------------
# A built site is DERIVED: every file in it comes from the teacher's notes
# and can be made again. It used to be written to
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output, INSIDE the working folder — where a cloud
# service uploads every build and charges it to the teacher's quota, Time
# Machine backs it up, a zip or a Finder copy carries it, and Get Info
# counts it. It lives here instead, for EVERY working folder rather than
# only the synced ones: the benefit is not confined to syncing, and one
# code path is one code path.
#
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output becomes a SYMLINK to this folder, so every
# script, every scheduled publish and every teacher at the command line
# still names the same path and still finds the site. Under $HOME on
# purpose: the container VM mounts only the home folder, so a builds
# folder anywhere else would appear EMPTY inside the container and every
# build would seem to vanish. It is bind-mounted into the container at the
# SAME absolute path, so the link resolves to the same place on both sides.
#
# The identical rule is in the app (BuildOutputLocation.swift) and written
# down in contracts/shared-rules.json -> buildOutputLocation. It is here as
# well because a teacher at the command line, and a publish scheduled with
# launchd, have no app to do it for them.
# ${HOME%/} rather than $HOME: a trailing slash would make this path differ
# from the one Docker stores (it cleans a mount destination), and the "does
# this container have the builds mount" check below would then be false on
# every run and recreate the container every time.
BUILD_ROOT="${HOME%/}/Library/Application Support/Plantoir/builds/${WORKDIR_ID}"

    # recipes from deleting each other's image on every switch, which would
    # cost a multi-minute, network-dependent rebuild each time.
    # Docker's own age column decides this, and deliberately so. The obvious
    # alternative — inspect '{{.Created}}' and compare timestamps — is a trap:
    # that field comes back in LOCAL time WITH an offset ("...T14:17:14-04:00"),
    # not the UTC "...Z" it looks like, so comparing it against a UTC cutoff is
    # silently wrong by the offset, in whichever direction the machine sits
    # from Greenwich. ('docker images --filter since=' is no help either — it
    # takes an image NAME, not a duration; the duration filters belong to
    # 'docker image prune', the blanket command this must never use.)
    #
    # Anything still measured in hours or minutes is left alone. Docker says
    # "N hours ago" up to 48 hours, so the guard is at least one day and in
    # practice up to two — erring long, which is the safe direction.
