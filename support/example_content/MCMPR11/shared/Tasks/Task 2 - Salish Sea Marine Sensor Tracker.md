## What you are making

A Python telemetry data analysis engine that ingests, cleans, and analyzes environmental sensor streams from marine observation stations in the **Salish Sea** (including the **Strait of Georgia VENUS observatory**, **Saanich Inlet subsea node**, and **Haro Strait acoustic buoy**).

The Salish Sea is an ecologically vulnerable marine corridor facing urban runoff, ocean acidification, warming events (marine heatwaves), and heavy vessel traffic that impacts the endangered **Southern Resident Killer Whale** population. High-frequency oceanographic sensors record gigabytes of telemetry every week. Scientists need automated software to detect environmental anomalies—such as sudden drops in dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) or dangerous surface temperature spikes.

## Computational Requirements

Your data pipeline must implement:

1. **Structured Data Ingestion:**
   - Parse CSV/TSV data streams where each record contains: `timestamp`, `station_id`, `temperature_c`, `salinity_psu`, `dissolved_o2`, and `acoustic_noise_db`.
   - Implement graceful recovery for malformed lines, missing fields, or out-of-range sensor noise (e.g. sensor disconnect reporting `-999.0`).
2. **Definite Iteration and Rolling Statistics:**
   - Maintain lists for each measurement dimension.
   - Compute descriptive statistics manually (using explicit loops rather than high-level black-box functions): mean, minimum, maximum, and rolling 24-hour moving averages.
3. **Threshold Anomaly Identification:**
   - **Marine Heatwave Alert:** Surface temperature $> 2.5^\circ\text{C}$ above seasonal baseline for $\ge 48$ consecutive hours.
   - **Hypoxia Event:** Dissolved Oxygen $< 3.0\text{ mg/L}$ (severe hypoxia $< 1.4\text{ mg/L}$).
   - **Freshwater Influx:** Salinity $< 27.0\text{ PSU}$ indicating massive Fraser River freshet or atmospheric river flood runoff.
   - **Acoustic Disturbance:** Ambient vessel noise $> 120.0\text{ dB}$ in Southern Resident Killer Whale feeding zones.
4. **Structured Incident Export:**
   - Output a clean tabular report to the console and export formatted incident records to an output file.

## Case Study in Software Ethics: The Volkswagen Diesel Defeat Device

In 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency discovered that Volkswagen had installed software in millions of diesel vehicles designed specifically to detect when the car was undergoing laboratory emissions testing (by monitoring steering wheel angle, engine run time, vehicle speed, and barometric pressure). When the software detected test conditions, it dialed up emissions controls to pass the test; during real-world driving, it disabled controls, emitting up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$).

**The Crucial Insight for Computer Programmers:**
The defeat device was not a mechanical breakdown or an accidental bug; it was **deliberate, carefully engineered code authored by software developers**.

Discuss with your partner and answer in your [[Learning Journey Log]]:
1. If a telemetry system detects that an industrial plant or vessel is exceeding environmental limits, who owns the data?
2. What are the ethical implications if a programmer is asked to write "smoothing filters" that conceal sensor spikes during official inspection periods?
3. How do professional codes of ethics (such as the ACM Code of Ethics or Engineers and Geoscientists BC) protect the public interest over employer directives?

## Success Criteria

| Quality | What strong work looks like | What it looks like when it is not there yet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Parsing & Cleaning** | Flawlessly parses CSV data; filters out missing values, NaN markers, and sensor disconnect codes (`-999.0`) without crashing. | Crashes when encountering empty lines, corrupted numbers, or missing CSV headers. |
| **Statistical Computations** | Accumulator loops calculate precise minimum, maximum, mean, and moving averages using clean, readable algorithms. | Inaccurate statistical math; incorrect accumulator formulas. |
| **Anomaly Filtering** | Correctly detects sustained multi-hour threshold violations and flags ecological incidents accurately. | Misses anomaly duration logic (triggers on single-point noise instead of sustained thresholds). |
| **Ethical Reflection** | Nuanced analysis of data integrity, sensor tampering, and the developer's responsibility to scientific truth. | Superficial reflection that treats software ethics as purely someone else's responsibility. |

Triangulation — the evidence you will not have unless you go and get it.

OBSERVE — Unit 2, Day 19, during the work period on descriptive statistics and 24-hour rolling moving averages
  Watch for: how the pair divides driver and navigator, and whether the keyboard actually changes hands when the timer goes.
  Going well: the pair works one window out on paper before trusting the loop with a thousand rows, and the navigator is reading the data rather than waiting.
  Stuck: one partner has held the keyboard for the whole period; the pair re-runs the entire pipeline after every small edit instead of testing the one function they changed.
  Record: two ticks per pair on the seating plan — "swapped on the timer" and "checked a window by hand" — plus a name where one partner has gone quiet.

TALK — Unit 2, Day 21, during peer verification on unannounced chaos datasets and the ethics review
  Ask: "How does your pipeline tell the difference between one faulty sensor reading and a sustained 48-hour marine heatwave?"
  A strong answer names the counter or window and what resets it — "I count consecutive hours over the threshold and reset on the first hour under it, so a single spike can never trigger the alert" — and can say what happens when a reading is missing rather than merely low. A weak one says "it checks the threshold" and stops.
  Then: "Your incident report goes to a DFO scientist. If your threshold is set a little wrong, which mistake would you rather your program made — a false alarm, or a hypoxic event it never flagged? Defend the choice."
  A strong answer commits to one and says who pays for it: a false alarm costs a scientist an afternoon, a missed event costs a benthic community nobody was watching. Listen for the threshold being treated as a decision somebody made, with a reason, rather than as a number that came with the assignment. A weak answer says "I would make it accurate".
  The first assesses K1.6 and K1.15: predicting what a change to the threshold logic would do, and what a test on a chaos dataset would show.
  The second assesses T1.2 and T1.4: naming who bears the cost of a design choice, and the values sitting behind where a threshold gets set.
  Record: note key arguments and student reasoning in the course tracking log.

The product evidence is the Python data pipeline script, exported cleaned CSV and incident JSON files, and reflection in the Learning Journey Log.
