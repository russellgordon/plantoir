"""
What a course calls its class pages, and which folder they live in.

Two questions with one answer between them, kept in one module because both
are asked by `setup_course.py` when a course is made and by `build_site.py`
every time it is built — and because a rule with two implementations is this
project's characteristic failure. `build_site.py` re-exports the folder half
under its old names so its callers and `test_class_folder.py` are unchanged.

## What a course calls the first half of a class page's name

Class pages are named "Unit 2, Day 3". Until 2026-09-01 that first word was not
a preference but a structural assumption: the regex that decides whether a page
is a class page, the page the "next class" button writes, and the curriculum
map's idea of what a course TEACHES all had it built in. Teachers who organise
by "Module" or "Thread" could rename the pages in Obsidian and quietly lose
every feature that recognises a class page — and the coverage map does not fail
when it finds none, it falls back to counting every published page, which is a
wrong map that reports success.

A course records its word in `course_config.json` as `unit_word`. **ABSENT
means "Unit"**, which is what every course made before this key existed says,
and what a course made from scratch still says unless the teacher chooses
otherwise. Since 2026-09-10 the word can also be changed on a course already
in use, from the app's Course Settings: the app renames every class page and
follows the links, then writes the new word here. Nothing in the build changes
for that — it reads the word from the configuration on every run.

**"Day" is deliberately fixed.** A teacher who says "Thread" almost certainly
still says "Day 3", and a second configurable word would double the migration
for something nobody asked for.

**This module holds the rule; `build_site.py` holds this build's answer.** The
split matters: the rule is shared with `setup_course.py`, which uses it to
rewrite a payload on the way into a new course, and that runs long before any
build.

    WHERE A NEW CLASS PAGE IS WRITTEN.

    The course's own `class_folder` FIRST, when it is set and still one of the
    per-section folders; only then the old guess — the first entry whose name
    contains "class" (case-insensitive), else the first entry, else the literal
    "All Classes".

    **Why the key exists.** Guessing by the word "class" quietly decided what a
    teacher was allowed to call this folder. Somebody whose vocabulary is
    "Thread 2, Day 3" would sensibly call it "All Days" — and under the guess
    alone that folder is not found, so the first per-section folder is used
    instead and the curriculum map counts the wrong pages. The map does not
    FAIL when that happens: it falls back to counting every published page,
    which is a wrong map that reports success. Recording the answer is what
    makes the vocabulary the teacher's rather than Plantoir's.

    The guess is KEPT as the fallback rather than replaced, because every
    course made before this key existed has no `class_folder` and must go on
    working exactly as it did.

    Substring matching is safe here because the list is a short curated one the
    teacher chose — it is NOT safe against arbitrary paths, which is what
    `_is_class_page_path` in build_site.py is careful about.

    Naming and membership are the same question only when a course has ONE such
