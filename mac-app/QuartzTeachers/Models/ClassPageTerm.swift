/// What a course calls the first half of a class page's name.
///
/// Class pages are named "Unit 2, Day 3". Until 2026-09-01 that first word was
/// not a preference but a structural assumption, built into the regex that
/// decides whether a page is a class page, into the page the next-class button
/// writes, and into the curriculum map's idea of what a course TEACHES. Some
/// teachers organise by "Module" or "Thread"; renaming the pages in Obsidian
/// used to lose them every feature that recognises a class page — and the
/// coverage map does not fail when it finds none, it falls back to counting
/// every published page, which is a wrong map that reports success.
///
/// A course records its word in `course_config.json` as `unit_word`. **ABSENT
/// means "Unit"**, which is what every course made before this key existed
/// says. The Python half of the rule is `scripts/class_pages.py`, and
/// `contracts/class-planning.json` → `pageNaming` carries the cases both
/// suites run.
///
/// **"Day" is deliberately fixed.** A teacher who says "Thread" almost
/// certainly still says "Day 3", and a second configurable word would double
/// the migration for something nobody asked for.
///
/// **The choice is offered at course creation, and again in Course Settings
/// once the course is in use.** The ready-made pages are poured in the
/// teacher's word as the course is made; renaming a course's pages later is
/// `UnitWordRenamer`, which renames every class page, retitles it and
/// follows the links, with a backup first and a record of a rename under way.
