## Overview of the Final Evaluation

The Computer Programming 11 Final Evaluation assesses your ability to read, debug, engineer, and ethically critique software systems under realistic technical constraints.

## Part A: Code Review & Defect Analysis (45 Minutes)

You are handed a legacy Python script written for a BC municipal water reservoir monitoring station in the Okanagan Valley. The script is supposed to monitor reservoir depth, calculate discharge rates through spillway gates, and flag flood stage alerts. However, the municipal engineers report that during heavy spring snowmelt (freshet), the script produced erratic warnings and crashed.

### The Broken Legacy Code

```python
# BC Municipal Water District - Reservoir Telemetry Monitor
def check_reservoir(station_name, readings, threshold):
    print("Processing station: " + station_name)
    total = 0
    max_depth = 0
    anomalies = []
    
    # Process readings list
    for i in range(len(readings)):
        val = readings[i]
        total = total + val
        if val > max_depth:
            max_depth = val
        if val >= threshold:
            anomalies.append(i)
            
    avg_depth = total / len(readings)
    
    # Calculate spillway discharge status
    if avg_depth > 18.0:
        status = "CRITICAL: Open Emergency Spillway"
    elif avg_depth > 14.0:
        status = "ELEVATED: Standard Discharge Active"
    else:
        status = "NORMAL: Gates Closed"
        
    return {
        "station": station_name,
        "average": avg_depth,
        "peak": max_depth,
        "flood_hours": len(anomalies),
        "status": status
    }
```

### Your Tasks for Part A:
1. **Identify 3 latent software bugs or vulnerabilities** in this script:
   - What happens if `readings` is an empty list (e.g. sensor telemetry blackout)?
   - What happens if `readings` contains negative numbers due to a frozen pressure transducer?
   - How does string concatenation in the print statement fail if `station_name` is passed as a numerical ID?
2. **Refactor the function** to be robust, defensive, and PEP 8 compliant, including docstrings, type hinting, and custom exception handling.

## Part B: Live Technical Challenge — Emergency Flood Logistics Dispatcher (75 Minutes)

### Scenario
During an atmospheric river event in Southwestern British Columbia, emergency sandbag pallets and water extraction pumps must be dispatched from three regional supply hubs (Surrey, Abbotsford, Hope) to flooded communities across the Fraser Valley.

### Specifications
Write a modular Python program `flood_dispatch.py` that:
1. Maintains supply inventory for each hub (Sandbags, Industrial Pumps, Emergency Generators) using a dictionary.
2. Ingests community requisition requests (Community Name, Urgency Tier 1–3, Requisition Quantities).
3. Allocates supplies prioritizing Tier 1 (Critical Infrastructure at immediate breach risk) over Tier 2 and 3.
4. Decrements hub inventories and flags unfulfilled requests with detailed shortfalls.
5. Employs modular design with pure helper functions and includes at least 3 automated `assert` tests verifying edge-case allocations.

## Part C: Technical Essay — Software Ethics, Public Safety & Developer Liability (60 Minutes)

Choose **two** of the following real-world software engineering ethical crises and write a structured, 500-word comparative essay:

1. **The Volkswagen Diesel "Defeat Device" (2015):** Software deliberately programmed to circumvent regulatory environmental standards.
2. **The Boeing 737 MAX MCAS Flight Control Failures (2018–2019):** Single angle-of-attack sensor dependency, lack of sensor disagreement warnings, and failure to document automated override behaviors in pilot manuals.
3. **The UK Post Office Horizon Scandal (Fujitsu, 2000–2024):** Flawed financial accounting software that produced phantom shortfalls, resulting in false criminal convictions due to blind institutional trust in computer output.
4. **The CrowdStrike Global IT Outage (July 2024):** Unvalidated kernel-level configuration update deployment causing worldwide airport, hospital, and emergency dispatch crashes.

### Essay Prompts to Address:
- What technical shortcuts, institutional pressures, or design flaws caused the crisis?
- What was the ethical responsibility of the individual software developers who authored, tested, and reviewed the code?
- How should modern software development organizations implement peer review, independent auditing, and whistleblower protections to prevent similar catastrophes?

Triangulation — the evidence you will not have unless you go and get it.

OBSERVE — Unit 4, Day 17, during the final evaluation walkthrough and the Part A code review practice
  Watch for: how a student reads code they did not write — top to bottom once, or straight to the loop that looks wrong.
  Going well: traces the reservoir script by hand with a small set of readings, including an empty list, before saying anything about it; annotates the printout rather than holding it all in their head.
  Stuck: declares the script fine because the variable names read sensibly; hunts for a syntax error when the fault is in the logic.
  Record: on the diagnostic sheet, note who found each of the three latent defects unaided, and who found one only after a nudge.

TALK — Unit 4, Day 18, during the one-on-one portfolio review and open clinic
  Ask: "Part B will ask you to fill Tier 1 emergency requests before anything goes to lower tiers. Your Task 4 dispatch code is the closest thing you have already built — walk me through the structure you would reach for, and what the loop does when the stock runs out halfway through a tier."
  A strong answer commits to a structure and a rule — requests sorted by tier, stock decremented as it is allocated, a partial fill recorded rather than skipped — and can say what their program should print when nothing is left. A weak one describes the situation again without naming a data structure.
  Then: "Of the four cases in Part C, which one is closest to a mistake you could actually make in code you write next year — and what in your own practice would catch it first?"
  A strong answer picks the case for a specific reason — an unvalidated file reaching production, an output nobody was allowed to challenge — and names something real from this course that would catch it: the test that runs before the merge, the log that keeps the raw row, the peer review on Day 13. A weak one picks the most famous case and retells it.
  The first assesses K1.8 and K1.11: choosing control structures and turning a written specification into a plan for code, out loud, before the evaluation.
  The second assesses T1.2 and T1.4: recognizing the unintended consequence at the heart of a real failure, and locating the same risk in their own practice.
  Record: one line per student in the final assessment record.

The product evidence is the completed refactored code (Part A), flood dispatch program (Part B), technical ethics essay (Part C), and cumulative software portfolio in the Learning Journey Log.
