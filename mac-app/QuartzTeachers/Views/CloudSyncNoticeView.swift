/// No `fixedSize` anywhere in here, on purpose. A text told to keep its
/// vertical size inside a stack that proposes it a narrow width wraps to a
/// word per line and becomes hundreds of points tall — which is what pushed
/// the window's path bar off the bottom of the screen the first time this
/// notice was shown. The texts take the width they are given and wrap in it;
/// `CloudSyncNoticeLayoutTests` measures the result. The whole failure class,
/// its four occurrences and the fixes that do NOT work are written up in
/// `documentation/09-mac-app.md` → "A blank window: when a child claims a size
/// the window cannot give".
