# 3. The Launcher Scripts

[◀ Previous: The Docker Image](02-docker-image.md) · [Back to index](README.md) · [Next: Course Setup ▶](04-course-setup.md)

The launchers are the only files that live on the teacher's computer. Each
task ships in three flavours:

| Task | macOS | Windows entry point | Windows implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Set up a course | `setup.sh` | `setup.bat` | `setup.ps1` |
| Preview a section | `preview.sh` | `preview.bat` | `preview.ps1` |
| Deploy a section | `deploy.sh` | `deploy.bat` | `deploy.ps1` |

The `.sh` scripts target macOS; the `.bat`/`.ps1` pairs are their Windows
peers. (`deploy.sh` enforces this explicitly — it depends on the macOS
Keychain and exits with a pointer to `deploy.ps1` on any other OS.)

The `.bat` files are thin wrappers: they locate the `.ps1` file sitting next
to them and run it with `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
(`setup.bat` prefers PowerShell 7's `pwsh` when available). All real Windows
logic is in the `.ps1` scripts, which mirror the bash versions.

All launchers share the same responsibilities, in order:

## 1. Detect the host OS

A small `_detect_host_os` function (`uname -s` → `mac`/`windows`/`linux`)
determines which command syntax to show in help text and, crucially, is
passed into the container as `--host-os` so the Python scripts can print
copy-pasteable follow-up commands in the right dialect (`./preview.sh …` vs
`.\preview.bat …`).

## 2. Resolve which image to use

Every launcher derives the image from the folder's build recipe: the tag is
`teaching-quartz:src-<hash of the recipe>`, built locally when missing.

- `--image REF` — substitute a specific already-built image (this is how
  `verify.sh` drives the launchers against its own `dev-test` build).
- `--port N` (preview only) — serve on container port N (8081–8084), so up
  to four previews per working folder can run at once — the macOS app uses
  this to preview sections side by side in separate windows. Each preview
  only ever stops a server on its own port.

  A build for publishing (`--build-only`) also stops a preview, but matches
  the section's build DIRECTORY rather than a port — it is never given one,
  and guessing the default took down other sections' previews. See
  [the build pipeline](05-build-pipeline.md#a-build-for-publishing-stops-that-sections-preview).
- `--stop` (preview only) — end this section's leftover processes and exit.
  Ending the host-side launcher does not stop the build or server it started
  inside the container: idle for a server, real CPU for a mid-flight build.
  This reclaims them, and **must never start anything** — no engine
  bootstrap, no image build, no container creation, because if nothing is
  running there is nothing to stop. The app runs it behind Stop Preview,
  navigating away, closing a window, and cancelling a publish.

  It ships the rule INTO the container over stdin rather than running a copy
  baked into the image, and that is deliberate: stop mode runs against
  whatever container is already there, which right after an upgrade was built
  from the previous image and has no such file. Naming a baked path fails
  with a message nobody sees — both callers discard this launcher's output
  and neither checks its exit code — while the build it was asked to stop
  carries on.

### One container per working folder

Each working folder gets its own container, named
`teaching-quartz-<hash>` where the hash is the first eight characters of
`pwd -P | shasum -a 256` — so two folders (this year's courses and last
year's, say) never repoint each other's mounts, and can preview at the same
time. At creation the launcher probes for a free block of HOST ports
(bases 8081, 8091, 8101, 8111, 8121, 8131 — four site ports each, plus a
matching +1000 websocket block for Quartz's live reload) and maps it to
the container's fixed ports 8081–8084 and 9081–9084; `preview.sh` prints the
resolved address ("Preview will be available at: …"), which is what the app
and a terminal teacher should open. The old shared `teaching-quartz`
container is retired automatically the first time a per-folder container is
created. The macOS app stops a folder's container (a fast `docker stop`,
not a removal) when the last window using that folder closes, and on quit —
the container holds no content, and restarts in about a second on the next
preview.
- `--context NAME` (setup only) — select a Docker context.
- `--image REF` — use a specific already-built image instead of resolving
  one from the recipe (how `verify.sh` points the launchers at its
  `dev-test` build). In `preview.sh` the image pre-parser deliberately
  scans the whole argument list, since the flag follows the course and
  section.

The scripts then ensure a container runtime is available (next section)
and build the image locally if the recipe's tag is missing — nothing is
ever pulled from a registry.

### Staying up to date

The image tag is a hash of the folder's build recipe, so staleness is
structural rather than checked-for: an updated recipe (delivered by an app
update refreshing `.toolchain/` — the full recipe folder the app mirrors
into every working folder) means a new tag, a local rebuild on the next
run, and a recreated container. The hash covers only recipe files: the
`find` prunes `.git`, `courses`, `mac-app`, `node_modules`,
`.merged_output`, and `.verify-export.*`, so build outputs never steer
the tag (from the repository root they once did, at the cost of minutes
of checksumming per run). The old pull-and-compare update machinery
(`--update-image`, digest checks, the update prompt) is gone.

`verify.sh` guards the launchers themselves: among its checks, every
helper function a launcher calls must be defined in that same launcher
file — the three scripts share copied helper blocks, and a helper missing
from one of them is exit 127 at runtime on the one path nobody tested.

## 3. Container runtime bootstrap (no Docker Desktop)

Docker Desktop is deliberately not required. Every launcher carries an
`ensure_container_runtime` (bash) / `Ensure-ContainerRuntime` (PowerShell)
step that runs before the first `docker` command and removes what used to be
a manual step ("open Docker Desktop and wait for the engine to start"):

**Fast path (both platforms).** If `docker info` already succeeds — any
working engine, including Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop if a teacher
happens to have one — the launcher uses it as-is and does nothing else.

**macOS: [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima).** Colima runs a
lightweight Linux VM with a Docker engine inside, driven entirely from the
command line. The bash launchers:

1. Use whatever is already on the machine — Homebrew installs included —
   found by `command -v`. Nothing is installed over a working tool.
2. Download whatever is missing as a pinned static binary into
   `~/Library/Application Support/Plantoir/tools/bin` (buildx into
   `~/.docker/cli-plugins`): Colima `v0.10.3`, Lima `2.2.0`, Docker CLI
   `29.7.2`, buildx `v0.36.1`. **No Homebrew and no administrator rights** —
   a teacher cannot be asked for a password they may not have.
3. Start Colima (`--vm-type vz` when the VM is first created) — sized from the Mac it is running on rather than pinned.
   `_colima_cpus` takes half the cores (floor 2, cap 6) and
   `_colima_memory_gb` a third of the RAM (floor 4 GB, cap 12 GB), so an 8 GB
   laptop gets exactly the old 2 CPU / 4 GB default and a 48 GB desktop gets
   6 CPUs and 12 GB. Deliberately not the whole machine: the teacher is using
   it while a site builds.
4. Poll `docker info` for up to a minute. If the VM claims to be running but
   the daemon never answers (a known Colima state after the Mac sleeps or
   shuts down uncleanly, where a plain `colima start` no-ops), force a clean
   `colima stop --force && colima start` cycle and wait again before giving
   up with manual-recovery instructions.

One consequence worth knowing: Colima's VM mounts the teacher's home
directory by default, so the working folder containing `courses/` must live
somewhere under `$HOME` (Desktop and Documents both qualify) for the bind
mount to work.

**Colima is treated as shared infrastructure.** Other Colima-based
toolchains (for example, a local Supabase development stack) may be using
the same VM on the same machine, so the launchers are deliberately polite
about it: a running engine is always used as-is, the scripts *start* Colima
when needed but never shut it down, and the only disruptive action — the
force-restart in step 4 — happens exclusively when the Docker daemon is
already dead, i.e. when no Colima-based tool is functional anyway
(containers with restart policies come back automatically afterwards).
Whichever toolchain creates the VM first determines its CPU/RAM size, so the
launchers may find a VM somebody else built. `_colima_growth_flags` handles
that under two rules: it only ever asks for MORE (a VM another toolchain
sized up keeps its size — we never shrink somebody else's), and it only does
so on a start of a STOPPED VM, because resizing recreates the VM and would
take down containers other tools are using. A VM that is already big enough
is left completely alone. A teacher who wants a different size still sets it
by hand with `colima stop && colima start --cpu N --memory M`, and the
launchers will respect anything at or above their own figure.

**Windows: Docker Engine inside WSL2.** Colima does not support Windows, but
it is not needed there — WSL2 is itself a lightweight, Microsoft-supplied
Linux VM, i.e. exactly the role Colima plays on macOS. The PowerShell
launchers:

1. Check for a native working `docker` first (fast path above).
2. Verify `wsl` exists and a distribution is installed; if not, point the
   teacher at the one-time `wsl --install` + reboot.
3. Probe for a running engine inside WSL (as the default user, then as root).
4. If the engine is absent, offer to install it right there
   (`apt-get install docker.io` as root inside the distro, then add the
   default user to the `docker` group); if merely stopped, start it with
   `service docker start` and poll until it answers.
5. Once the WSL engine is up, define a PowerShell function named `docker`
   that forwards every call through `wsl -e docker …`. Because functions
   take precedence over external commands, the rest of the script (and its
   dozens of existing `docker` call sites) work unchanged. Bind-mount paths
   are translated with `wslpath` (`C:\Users\me\courses` →
   `/mnt/c/Users/me/courses`), since the WSL engine sees Windows drives
   under `/mnt`. Published ports still appear on `localhost` thanks to
   WSL2's automatic localhost forwarding, so the preview URL is unchanged.

## 4. Mount-aware container lifecycle

This is the most subtle part of the launchers. Each working folder has its
own long-lived container (see "One container per working folder" above),
started as:

```bash
docker run -dit --name "teaching-quartz-${WORKDIR_ID}" \
  -v "$(pwd)/courses":/teaching/courses \
  -p ${HOST_BASE}-$((HOST_BASE+3)):8081-8084 \
  -p $((HOST_BASE+1000))-$((HOST_BASE+1003)):9081-9084 \
  "$IMAGE" tail -f /dev/null
```

where `WORKDIR_ID` is the folder hash and `HOST_BASE` the probed port
block. Every launcher inspects the existing container before using it:

1. **No `/teaching/courses` mount at all?** Recreate the container.
2. **Mounted from a different host folder than the current one?** Recreate
   it pointing at `$(pwd)/courses` (rare now that names are per-folder,
   but a moved folder keeps its old name with a stale mount).
3. **Running a different image than the recipe resolves?** Recreate — a
   container keeps running the version it was created from, so a changed
   recipe only takes effect through recreation.
4. **Missing the 9081–9084 websocket ports?** (An older container
   published only 8081; published ports cannot be changed after creation.)
   Recreate.
5. **Mount correct but not writable?** (Checked by creating and deleting a
   probe file inside the container.) **`setup.sh` and `deploy.sh` only** —
   `preview.sh` implements the other four checks but not this one, and no
   comment in it says why. Recreate. This catches macOS
   permission/ACL oddities after folder moves or restores.
6. Otherwise, start the container if stopped, or reuse it as-is.

Recreating the container is cheap because all state lives in the bind mount.

## 5. Per-task specifics

### `setup.sh`

- Creates `courses/` and `courses/_backups/` on the host if missing, and
  relaxes permissions (`chmod -R u+rwX,go+rwX`) so the container user can
  write regardless of UID mismatches.
- Captures the host timezone offset (`date +%z`) into `HOST_TZ_OFFSET` so
  frontmatter timestamps written inside the container match the teacher's
  wall clock ([why this matters](05-build-pipeline.md#dates-drive-everything)).
- If `--no-backup` is being passed through, demands explicit confirmation
  first.
- Finally: `docker exec -it "teaching-quartz-${WORKDIR_ID}" python3 /opt/scripts/setup_course.py …`

### `preview.sh`

- Takes `COURSE SECTION` as positional arguments, plus pass-through flags
  understood by `build_site.py`: `--include-social-media-previews`,
  `--force-npm-install`, `--full-rebuild`, `--build-only` — plus its own
  `--port N` (container port 8081–8084), `--image REF`, and `--stop`, which
  is handled entirely by the launcher and never reaches `build_site.py`.
- Checks host-side that the course is set up (`course_config.json` exists)
  and that the section folder is there. The `section_numbers` check itself
  runs in the container once it is up (`docker exec … python3 -`), so a typo
  like section `2` in a course with sections `1,3,4` still fails before any
  build starts, with a helpful message.
- Runs `build_site.py`, which (by default) ends by serving the site on
  the requested container port (8081–8084), with Quartz's live-reload
  websocket on port + 1000 (`--wsPort`) — the reason the container
  publishes both ranges. The reachable HOST address is the folder's
  probed block; `preview.sh` prints it.

### `deploy.sh`

- Normalizes the course code to uppercase and includes a friendly guard for a
  classic Ontario data-entry error: a course code ending in the digit `0`
  where the letter `O` (an "Open" course) was intended, e.g. `ICD2O` typed as
  `ICD20`. If the `O` variant exists on disk it offers to correct it.
- Verifies the built site exists at
  `courses/<CODE>/.merged_output/section<N>/public/` and tells you to run
  preview/`--build-only` first if not.
- **Token handling** — the launcher, not the container, owns the Netlify
  Personal Access Token:
  - macOS: stored in the **macOS Keychain** under the service name
    `containerized-quartz-netlify` via `/usr/bin/security`.
  - Windows: stored in **Windows Credential Manager** under the same target
    name, accessed through P/Invoke (`CredRead`/`CredWrite`) from PowerShell.
  - Both migrate tokens from a legacy obfuscated file store
    (`courses/.internal/tokens.json`, XOR+base64 with a key file) into the
    OS credential store, then delete the legacy entry.
  - On first run the script opens the Netlify token-creation page, validates
    the pasted token against `GET /api/v1/user`, and saves it.
    `--reset-token` (or `--logout`) clears it.
  - The token is injected into the container by piping it to a root-only
    temp file (`umask 077`) and reading it inside the `docker exec` shell
    into the `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable — it never appears in
    a process argument list on the host.
- Finally runs `deploy.py` inside the container
  (see [Deployment](07-deployment.md)).

## A note on line endings

The repository stores every file with LF endings. At image-build time,
`unix2dos` converts the `.bat`/`.ps1` copies baked into the image's
`export-scripts` bundle to CRLF (Windows batch files can misbehave with
bare LF), and `verify.sh` checks the CRLF survives. Teachers normally
receive launchers via the app's `.toolchain/` mirror rather than
`export-scripts`, but the exported copies remain a supported escape hatch
and differ from the repo versions in line endings only.

## One rule for stopping a section's preview

New on 2026-09-05, and the closing of a `TODO.md` item. Read
`contracts/shared-rules.json` → `stopPreview` first; this explains why it is
shaped the way it is, and what was rejected.

**What was wrong.** One question — *which processes belong to this section's
preview?* — was answered in three places: `preview.sh --stop` (a `/proc` sweep
by working directory, run inside the container), `preview.ps1 --stop`
(`Win32_Process` by command line, plus a descendant walk, run natively), and
`build_site.py` (command line plus `--serve`, inside the container, written
because both of the others are HOST scripts and it is not). The reason for the
third is sound and has not gone away; the problem was never that it existed,
it was that nothing held the three to the same answer.

**The finding that changed the design, and the reason a straight refactor
would have been wrong.** They were not three copies of one rule. They were
three PARTIAL rules, and each saw something the others could not:

- A **working directory** catches a child launched by a RELATIVE path, which
  carries no directory to match on. `npm install` runs exactly that way, and
  so do the esbuild workers under it.
- A **command line** catches the Python driver. `build_site.py` never calls
  `os.chdir` — it passes `cwd=` to its CHILDREN — so the driver sits in the
  container's `/teaching` for the whole build. Through every in-process phase
  (copying the scaffold, copying content, social cards, the rsync mirror) it
  is the only process there is to find, and the mac's sweep found nothing and
  printed "Stopped 0 process(es)".
- Only **`preview.ps1`** walked descendants — Windows', and it was right.

So picking any one of the three as "the" implementation would have shipped
that one's blind spot to both platforms. The rule is a **disjunction of three
evidences, plus a walk down the process tree**, and it stops strictly more
than any of the three did alone.

**Why the cases are process SNAPSHOTS rather than single processes.** The
first design had each case describe one process — name, command line, working
directory — with an expected verdict. That cannot be run on both platforms,
for two independent reasons. `Win32_Process` exposes no working directory at
all, so every cwd case would be unanswerable there. And the descendant
walk is not a property of any single process: it is a rule over parent links
across the whole list. A case is therefore a small process TABLE with `pid`,
`ppid`, `name`, `commandLine` and `cwd`, and the expected answer is the list
of pids to stop. A platform that cannot see one kind of evidence must still
reach the same verdict — through the walk — and that is exactly the property
worth testing rather than assuming.

**Two modes, because there are genuinely two questions.** `everything` is the
launcher's `--stop`: reclaim the server, the build, the driver, and everything
under them. `servingOnly` is `build_site.py --build-only`: remove ONLY the
preview server that would otherwise overwrite the publish build a second later
through its own host mirror. A build must never be stopped in that mode,
because the build being protected is itself a build of this section — and the
process asking is the driver the rule would otherwise recognise.

**The version-independence trap, which is the one to carry if anyone ever adopts
`--match-stdin`.** `preview.sh` pipes the recipe's copy of the rule into the
container over stdin rather than running the copy baked into the image. Stop
mode must never build anything, so it runs against whatever container is
ALREADY there — right after an upgrade, one built from the previous image,
with no such file. Naming a baked path would make `docker exec` fail with a
message nobody sees (both callers send the launcher's output to the null
device and neither checks its exit code) while the build it was asked to stop
carried on burning CPU. This is exactly once per teacher per upgrade, and only
when something was running, which is the only time the mode matters at all.
`verify.sh` section 6d proves it by deleting the file from a running container
and stopping a preview anyway.

**Rejected: making `preview.ps1` call the shared Python.** It would leave one
implementation and two ports, which is better, and the `--match-stdin` entry
point exists so it can be. It was not done from the mac because `--stop` must never
start anything and whether Python is reliably resolvable on that path at that
moment is a question only a Windows machine can answer. Measure it there; say
what you find.

**Rejected: extracting `preview.ps1`'s matcher into a new `.ps1` file beside
the launchers.** A test could then dot-source it without running the script.
But a new file there has to be added to `ToolchainMirror.Launchers` and
`RecipeRootFiles`, the Dockerfile's `COPY … /opt/export/` and its `unix2dos`
line, `project.yml`, and the mac's own refresh lists — five hand-maintained
lists, which is the precise failure `contracts/toolchain.json` →
`recipeFolders` exists to record. The functions are defined inside
`preview.ps1`'s stop block instead. Making them dot-sourceable is a
real cost to weigh, not a free tidy-up.

**A case a platform may skip, and why that is not a loophole.** One case —
"a process is caught by its working directory alone" — can be decided ONLY
with a working directory, which `Win32_Process` does not expose. Rather than
delete it (it pins the evidence that catches `npm install`) or let it fail on
Windows, cases carry `needsEvidence`, and a runner without that evidence skips
it naming what was missing. The loophole this could obviously become is closed
by a test rather than by discipline: the mac's suite BLINDS every case — takes
the working directories away — and asserts that a marked case's verdict
changes and an unmarked case's does not. It caught a case wearing the marker
that did not need it on the first run, which is exactly the drift the marker
would otherwise invite.

**Three holes the second review found, all in the rule itself, all the same
family as the bug being fixed.** A blank or root build directory was evidence
for EVERY process, because an empty string is a prefix of everything — a
caller that lost track of which section it was asking about would have swept
the whole container rather than failed. A target that is a SUFFIX of a longer
absolute path matched as well, so `/x/tmp/quartz-builds/ADA1O/section1` was
evidence for `/tmp/quartz-builds/ADA1O/section1`. Both are the section1 /
section10 mistake pointed in different directions: one about where a path
ends, one about where it begins, one about whether it is a path at all. The
lesson worth keeping is that fixing a boundary bug in one direction is not
finishing it — check every edge of the match, and check that the thing being
matched is a real value.

**One harness lesson, learned twice in one afternoon.** A process that scans
other processes for a marker string finds ITSELF — the marker is on its own
command line. In `verify.sh` 6d this first inflated a count so that every
check in the section failed while the code under test was correct, and then,
in the cleanup, made the script SIGKILL itself part-way through: it printed
nothing, exited quietly, and left behind the very processes it was written to
collect. The second one was found only by checking the container afterwards
rather than trusting a green run. Exclude the harness's own process id, and treat
"scanning for a string I am myself carrying" as a shape worth recognising —
the same trap that `stop_preview.py` already guards against for the real rule.

**What was measured, not decided.** The two `preview.ps1` prefix bugs were
found by reading, and both are real: `$lower.Contains($sectionNeedle)` with a
needle ending `\section1` matches `\section10`, and
`$lower.Contains('--section=1')` matches `--section=10`. Each was reproduced
as a contract case, and each case was checked by putting the fault back into
the shared Python and watching that case — and only that case — fail. The same
was done for the descendant walk. A green suite proves nothing about a case
that cannot fail.

## `--image` is the mac's flag alone

Found 2026-09-06 while wiring the contract's case lists into the Windows suite.
`contracts/app-rules.json` → `launcherFlags.deployExtras` named `--diagnose` and `--image <tag>` as flags
the launchers must both accept. `deploy.sh` parses `--image`; `deploy.ps1`
does not, and cannot — Windows has had no image to name since it dropped
Docker on 2026-08-19. Recorded as `macOnly` rather than closed by adding a
dead flag to `deploy.ps1` so a test would go green, which is the shape of fix
`WINDOWS-BOOTSTRAP.md` §0 exists to forbid.
