# Release Strategy & Production Deployment

Plantoir is built for non-technical teachers. Delivering a professional, friction-free experience across both macOS and Windows requires solving three core challenges:
1. **Zero Security Warnings**: macOS Gatekeeper notarization approval and Windows SmartScreen reputation.
2. **Zero Admin Rights**: The app must install and run seamlessly on managed school computers where teachers do not have administrator permissions.
3. **Zero Dead Links**: The marketing website’s download buttons must always point to live, functional release binaries.

## 1. The Red-Team Audit & Critical Traps

An adversarial architecture review uncovered five potential failure points that must be avoided:

1. **Mach-O & Dylibs in `Resources/`**:
   Apple's bundle structure rules require all dynamic libraries (`.dylib`) to live in `Contents/Frameworks/` and helper executables (`llama-server`) to live in `Contents/Helpers/` (or `Contents/MacOS/`). Placing them inside `Contents/Resources/` causes `codesign --strict` failures and notarization rejections.
2. **Hardened Runtime**:
   Apple Developer ID notarization **strictly requires** Hardened Runtime (`--options runtime`). Releases submitted without it are automatically rejected by Apple's `notarytool`.
3. **macOS ZIP vs. Stapled DMG**:
   A `.zip` file cannot be stapled with an Apple notarization ticket. An unstapled `.app` requires an online Gatekeeper check on launch; if a school network blocks or slows Apple's OCSP servers, the app hangs or shows a security warning. A `.dmg` **can be stapled** (`xcrun stapler staple`), enabling instant offline Gatekeeper verification and providing a clean "Drag to Applications" install experience.
4. **APFS vs. Legacy HFS+ Disk Images**:
   HFS+ disk images decompose accented Unicode characters in filenames into Normalization Form D (NFD). When an app containing bundled resource files is dragged from an HFS+ image onto an APFS volume, `codesign` detects a modified resource signature and fails with `a sealed resource is missing or invalid`. Creating the DMG with an APFS filesystem (`hdiutil create -fs APFS ...`) and ensuring bundled resource filenames are clean ASCII completely eliminates this failure mode.
5. **Windows ZIP vs. Inno Setup**:
   When teachers download a `.zip`, double-clicking `Plantoir.exe` from inside Windows Explorer's archive view launches the executable from `%TEMP%` without extracting DLLs, causing immediate crashes. A per-user Inno Setup installer (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`) installs cleanly to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Plantoir` with **zero UAC/admin prompts**, adds Start Menu/Desktop shortcuts, and manages clean uninstalls and updates.
6. **The Netlify / GitHub 404 Race Condition**:
   Pushing to `main` triggers Netlify to deploy the website in ~20 seconds. If GitHub is still uploading the 80 MB DMG or 60 MB Windows installer, teachers clicking "Download" will get a 404 error. The workflow must upload assets to a **GitHub Draft Release first**, publish the draft, and only *then* update and deploy the website.

## 2. macOS Release Architecture

### One-Time Prerequisites
1. **Developer ID Application Certificate**:
   - Visit [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) -> *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles* -> Certificates -> `+`.
   - Select **Developer ID Application** (not "Apple Development").
   - Download the `.cer` file and double-click to install it into your macOS Keychain.
2. **App Store Connect Credentials for `notarytool`**:
   - Generate an App-Specific Password at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com).
   - Store it securely in your macOS keychain profile:
     ```bash
     xcrun notarytool store-credentials "notarytool-profile" \
       --apple-id "your-apple-id@email.com" \
       --team-id "U2ZN2W2UQJ" \
       --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
     ```
3. **Install `create-dmg`** (optional, for styled disk image creation):
   ```bash
   brew install create-dmg
   ```

### Packaging & Signing Chain (`mac-app/publish.sh`)
The automated script executes the following sequence:
1. Fetches native `llama.cpp` (`mac-app/Vendor/fetch-llama.sh`).
2. Generates Xcode project (`xcodegen generate`) and builds Release (`xcodebuild`).
3. Relocates `.dylib` files into `Contents/Frameworks/` and `llama-server` into `Contents/Helpers/`.
4. Bottom-up codesigning:
   - Signs all real `.dylib` files (preserving symlinks) with Developer ID + `--timestamp` + `--options runtime`.
   - Signs `Contents/Helpers/llama-server` with Developer ID + `--timestamp` + `--options runtime`.
   - Signs `Plantoir.app` with Developer ID + `--timestamp` + `--options runtime` + entitlements.
5. Creates APFS-formatted `dist/Plantoir-macOS.dmg` with `/Applications` symlink.
6. Signs `dist/Plantoir-macOS.dmg` with Developer ID.
7. Submits DMG to Apple Notarization (`xcrun notarytool submit ... --wait`).
8. Staples the notarization ticket (`xcrun stapler staple dist/Plantoir-macOS.dmg`).
9. Verifies Gatekeeper acceptance (`spctl --assess`).

## 3. Windows Release Architecture

### One-Time Prerequisites
1. **Inno Setup**:
   ```powershell
   winget install --exact --id JRSoftware.InnoSetup
   ```
2. **Azure CLI & Sign Tool**:
   ```powershell
   winget install --exact --id Microsoft.AzureCLI
   dotnet tool install --global sign --prerelease
   ```

### Packaging & Signing Chain (`windows-app/publish.ps1`)
The automated PowerShell script executes:
1. `dotnet publish` for `Plantoir.csproj` and `Plantoir.Mcp.csproj` (win-x64 self-contained).
2. Copies `plantoir-mcp.exe` and `llama-server.exe` into the publish directory.
3. Signs all 5 internal binaries using Azure Trusted Signing with RFC 3161 timestamp.
4. Compiles `installer.iss` with Inno Setup to produce `dist/PlantoirSetup.exe` (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`, installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Plantoir`).
5. Signs `dist/PlantoirSetup.exe` with Azure Trusted Signing + timestamp.
6. Emits SHA-256 hash for release notes.

## 4. Marketing Website & Evergreen Download URLs

The website (`website/pages/index.html`) references evergreen download URLs:
- **macOS**: `https://github.com/russellgordon/plantoir/releases/latest/download/Plantoir-macOS.dmg`
- **Windows**: `https://github.com/russellgordon/plantoir/releases/latest/download/PlantoirSetup.exe`

GitHub automatically resolves `releases/latest/download/<filename>` to the newest published release carrying that asset name.

**The names are frozen, and renaming one breaks the site's download button
silently** — the evergreen URL keeps resolving, to nothing. `Plantoir-macOS.dmg`
and `PlantoirSetup.exe` are what the cards ask for; `Plantoir-win-x64.zip` is
also published, as a portable alternative nothing links to by that URL.

### Auto-update, when it arrives, needs both appcasts planned together

Neither app updates itself today. Windows is expected to adopt **WinSparkle**,
paired with the Inno Setup installer it already ships; the mac would adopt
**Sparkle**. Decided 2026-08-12, before either was built, because the decision
is cheap now and expensive later:

- **Both appcasts live on plantoir.app**, in this repository's `website/`.
- **Use per-platform file names from the very first one** —
  `appcast-windows.xml` and `appcast-macos.xml`, never a single `appcast.xml`.
  One shared feed would have each platform reading the other's releases, and
  splitting it afterwards means every already-installed copy is pointed at a
  URL that has stopped describing it.
- **Add the appcast edit to the checklist in
  [`RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md) when the first one lands.** A release that
  publishes binaries without updating the feed ships an update nobody is
  offered.

## 6. How to Cut a Release (Action Checklist)

1. On Windows: Run `powershell -File publish.ps1 -Sign` -> Copy `PlantoirSetup.exe` to Mac (or shared staging).
2. On Mac: Run `./mac-app/publish.sh -Sign` -> produces `Plantoir-macOS.dmg`.
3. In terminal / assistant: Ask Claude / Antigravity to **"Cut the release"**.
4. The automated skill drafts teacher-friendly release notes, confirms SHA-256 hashes, creates the draft release, uploads both assets, publishes the release, updates `site.json`, redraws the social card, and pushes to `main`.

## The Windows icon derives from `mac-app/Plantoir.icon`

`windows-app/Plantoir/Assets/make-icon.ps1` turns a full-bleed 1024px
Icon Composer export into the exe/.ico and About-panel assets, applying
the macOS rounded-rect silhouette; `site/icon.png` on plantoir.app
comes from the same export. If the icon art ever changes, tell the
Windows side so those derived assets are regenerated — nothing updates
them automatically.
