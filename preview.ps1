# windows-app/test_stop_preview.ps1 can run the contract's own cases
# against these exact functions. A matcher nobody can run against the
# cases is a matcher that drifts, which is the whole reason the rule was
# written down.
#
# WHICH processes belong to a section is a SHARED rule, in
# contracts/shared-rules.json -> stopPreview, implemented for the
# container side in scripts/stop_preview.py. It is implemented a second
# time here because `--stop` must never START anything, and reaching the
# Python copy would mean depending on the bundled interpreter at the
# moment a teacher is closing a window. What keeps the two from drifting
# is not that they share source - they cannot - but that they answer the
# SAME 23 cases. See documentation/03-launcher-scripts.md for the --match-stdin decision.
#
#   * three kinds of evidence, any one of which is enough - the process
#     sits in the section's build folder (never visible here:
#     Win32_Process has no working directory), its command line NAMES
#     that folder, or it is build_site.py with this course and this
#     section on its command line;
#   * plus every descendant of a match, because a child spawned with a
#     RELATIVE path (npx does) carries no evidence of its own;
#   * and every comparison ends at a BOUNDARY, never a bare substring.
#
# That last clause was not true here until 2026-09-05, and the bug it
# left is the reason the rule got written down: `...\section1` is a
# prefix of `...\section10`, and `--section=1` is a prefix of
# `--section=10`, so stopping section 1 also stopped section 10 - by
# both routes at once. It needs a course with ten or more sections,
# which nothing refuses.

# A path is NAMED by a command line only when what follows it is a
# boundary: another path segment, a quote, whitespace, or the end of
# the line. Allowing the end is still safe against the section1 /
# section10 trap, because what follows `section1` in `section10` is
# `0`, which is not a boundary.
#
# Separators are normalised because the contract says both count on both
# platforms: a native Windows run passes POSIX spellings around in
# places, and the two are the same folder. Without this, a command line
# written with forward slashes silently failed to match a needle built
# with Join-Path - measured 2026-09-05 against the contract's own cases.
