# There is NO corner masking here any more, and that is the point.

# There used to be a `mask_window_corners` that made each shot's four corners
# transparent with a guessed 11-point radius. It existed because the app-window
# shots could arrive from XCUITest's `window.screenshot()`, a RECTANGLE capture
# that bakes the corner curves against whatever was behind them and hands back
# opaque black specks.
#
# Every shot is now taken with `screencapture -o -l <window number>` — macOS's
# own window capture — and that already returns the curve antialiased with the
# corners at alpha 0. Measured, rather than assumed: the four corner pixels of
# such a capture read (0, 0, 0, 0). Masking a correct capture is not harmless,
# either: it multiplies a GUESSED radius over a real one, which erodes the
# curve when the guess is generous and leaves a fringe when it is mean.
#
# If black corners ever come back, the capture is wrong — find out why it did
# not go through `screencapture -l` instead of painting over it here.
