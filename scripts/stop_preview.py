"""
Which processes belong to a section's preview — the ONE answer.

This question used to be answered three times: `preview.sh --stop` swept
`/proc/<pid>/cwd` inside the container, `preview.ps1 --stop` matched command
lines natively through `Win32_Process`, and `build_site.py` matched command
lines again from inside the container because it cannot call either host
script. `TODO.md` had it as "one rule, three implementations", and by the time
it was picked up they had already drifted apart in three separate ways — one
of them a live bug (see `contracts/shared-rules.json` -> `stopPreview`).

**The three were not three copies of one rule. They were three PARTIAL rules**,
and that is the thing to understand before changing anything here:

- Matching on the working directory catches what a command line cannot: a
  child launched by a RELATIVE path carries no directory to match on, and
  `npm install` (build_site.py) runs exactly that way.
- Matching on the command line catches what a working directory cannot: **the
  Python driver itself.** `build_site.py` never calls `os.chdir` — it passes
  `cwd=` to its CHILDREN — so the driver sits in the container's `/teaching`
  for the whole build. A cwd sweep during any in-process phase (copying the
  scaffold, copying content, social cards, the rsync mirror) therefore found
  NOTHING, said "Stopped 0 process(es)", and left the build running. That was
  the mac's blind spot for as long as `--stop` has existed, and it is also why
  cancelling a deploy did not stop the deploy's build.

So the shared rule is a DISJUNCTION of three evidences, plus a walk down the
process tree to collect the children that carry no evidence of their own. Any
one evidence is enough; the walk then sweeps up the rest.

The rule is code and the CASES are test data — `contracts/shared-rules.json`
-> `stopPreview`, run by `scripts/test_stop_preview.py`. This module does NOT
read the contract at runtime, deliberately: `--stop` must work against a
container built from an older image, and coupling it to a file baked into the
image would give it a second way to fail at the worst moment.

What is deliberately NOT shared, because it is platform mechanics rather than
the rule: how the process list is obtained (`/proc` on Linux and inside the
container, `Win32_Process` via PowerShell on native Windows) and how a process
is ended (ask-then-insist on POSIX, since it has SIGTERM; a single
`TerminateProcess` on Windows, which has no equivalent to ask with).

Both snapshots are read HERE, so every caller of the rule gets the right one
for the platform it is on. That was not true until 2026-09-05: `/proc` was the
only reader, so on native Windows the list came back empty and
`build_site.py`'s own `stop_preview_serving()` stopped nothing — leaving the
overwrite race it exists to close wide open on that platform. See
documentation/03-launcher-scripts.md.

    * **A full path to `powershell.exe`**, from `%SystemRoot%`, falling back
      to the bare name. `CreateProcess` searches `System32` before `PATH`, so
      the bare name works today from every caller, but this runs during a
      publish and a publish should not depend on a `PATH` it did not set.
    * **`-InputObject @(...)`**, because `ConvertTo-Json` given exactly one
      process emits an object rather than an array (PowerShell 5.1 has no
      `-AsArray`), and a machine with exactly one matching process is not the
      machine anyone tests on.

    contract rather than papered over: the RULE is which processes, not how
