Two rules run this entire page. Neither of them ever changes, in any
kind of cell, under any conditions:

> [!important] Anode, oxidation. Cathode, reduction.
> **Oxidation always happens at the anode. Reduction always happens at
> the cathode.** In a galvanic cell, in an electrolytic cell, in a
> corroding pipe, in a battery on a shelf.
>
> What *does* change between the two kinds of cell is the **sign** of
> each electrode, and the two facts get tangled together constantly. Keep
> them separate: the anode-is-oxidation rule is about chemistry and is
> permanent; the sign is about which way you are pushing the electrons
> and is not.

The oxidation number rules, in the order they are applied:

1. An element on its own is 0. $\ce{Zn(s)}$, $\ce{O2}$,
   $\ce{Cl2}$ — all zero.
2. A monatomic ion takes the charge of the ion.
3. Oxygen is $-2$, except in peroxides, where it is $-1$.
4. Hydrogen is $+1$ with non-metals, and $-1$ with metals.
5. The sum over a neutral compound is 0; over an ion, it equals the
   charge.

Standard reduction potentials come from your data booklet. Values given
inside a question are given so everyone works from the same ones — and
before you use the booklet at all, read
[[Reading a Reduction Potential Table]], because the sign convention in
it catches nearly everyone once.

**1.** Define *half-reaction*, *oxidising agent*, *reducing agent*, and
*oxidation number*. Then assign oxidation numbers to the underlined
element in $\ce{MnO4-}$, $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$,
$\ce{H2O2}$, $\ce{SO4^2-}$, and $\ce{NaH}$.

> **Half-reaction**: one half of a redox process written on its own,
> showing either the loss of electrons or the gain, with the electrons
> written explicitly. Half-reactions do not happen in isolation —
> electrons lost by one substance are gained by another — but separating
> them is what makes the bookkeeping possible.
>

> which it does by taking electrons. So the oxidising agent is itself
> **reduced**. This crossover is the source of most of the confusion in
> the topic and it is worth saying out loud a few times.
>
> **Reducing agent**: the substance that causes another to be reduced by
> giving electrons, and is therefore itself **oxidised**.
>
> **Oxidation number**: a bookkeeping charge assigned to an atom as
> though every bond it takes part in were fully ionic. It is not a real
> charge. It is a device for tracking where electrons went, and its
> justification is entirely that it works.
>
> | Species | Working | Oxidation number |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | $\ce{MnO4-}$ | $\ce{Mn} + 4(-2) = -1$ | Mn is $+7$ |
> | $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ | $\ce{2Cr} + 7(-2) = -2$ | Cr is $+6$ |
> | $\ce{H2O2}$ | $2(+1) + 2\ce{O} = 0$ | O is $-1$ |
> | $\ce{SO4^2-}$ | $\ce{S} + 4(-2) = -2$ | S is $+6$ |
> | $\ce{NaH}$ | $(+1) + \ce{H} = 0$ | H is $-1$ |
>
> **The last two are the exceptions in the rule list, and they are there
> deliberately.** In hydrogen peroxide the two oxygens are bonded to
> each other, so neither can take electrons from the other, and each
> ends at $-1$ instead of $-2$. In sodium hydride the metal is less
> electronegative than the hydrogen, so the bookkeeping runs the other
> way and hydrogen is $-1$.
>
> Note also that manganese at $+7$ is nowhere near a real charge — no
> atom carries seven units of charge. It is a count, not a measurement,
> and treating it as a physical charge is where students start
> disbelieving the method.

**2.** For
$\ce{Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Zn^2+(aq) + Cu(s)}$,
identify what is oxidised, what is reduced, the oxidising agent, and the
reducing agent. Write both half-reactions.

> [!success]- Answer 2
> Track the oxidation numbers first:
>
> | Species | Before | After | Change |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Zn | 0 | $+2$ | Increased — **oxidised** |
> | Cu | $+2$ | 0 | Decreased — **reduced** |
>
> **Oxidation, at the anode:**
> $\ce{Zn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e-}$
>
> **Reduction, at the cathode:**
> $\ce{Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)}$
>
> - **Zinc is oxidised**, so zinc is the **reducing agent** — it gave
>   the electrons that reduced the copper.
> - **Copper(II) is reduced**, so copper(II) is the **oxidising agent**
>   — it took the electrons that oxidised the zinc.
>
> **Two checks that cost nothing.** The electrons must balance: two lost,
> two gained, so these half-reactions can be added directly with no
> multiplying. And each half-reaction must balance for charge: on the
> left of the oxidation, charge is 0; on the right, $+2$ and $2e^-$
> gives 0. ✓
>
> **The agent is always the opposite of what happened to it**, and the
> way to stop getting it backwards is to read the word "agent" as
> "the thing that did it to the other one".

**3.** Balance in acidic solution, using the half-reaction method:
$\ce{MnO4-(aq) + Fe^2+(aq) -> Mn^2+(aq) + Fe^3+(aq)}$

> [!success]- Answer 3
> **Split into half-reactions.**
>
> $\ce{MnO4- -> Mn^2+}$ and
> $\ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+}$
>
> **Balance the iron half**, which needs only electrons:
>
> $\ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+} + e^-$
>
> **Balance the manganese half**, in the standard order — element first,
> then oxygen with water, then hydrogen with $\ce{H+}$, then charge
> with electrons:
>
> $\begin{aligned} \ce{MnO4-} &\ce{-> Mn^2+ + 4H2O} \\ \ce{MnO4- + 8H+} &\ce{-> Mn^2+ + 4H2O} \\ \ce{MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e-} &\ce{-> Mn^2+ + 4H2O} \end{aligned}$
>
> Check the electron count on that last line: the left is
> $-1 + 8 - 5 = +2$ and the right is $+2$. ✓
>
> **Equalise the electrons.** One half gives up 1 electron, the other
> takes 5, so multiply the iron half by 5:
>
> $\ce{5Fe^2+ -> 5Fe^3+ + 5e-}$
>
> **Add and cancel the electrons:**
>
> $$\ce{MnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5Fe^2+(aq) -> Mn^2+(aq) + 4H2O(l) + 5Fe^3+(aq)}$$
>
> **The two checks that catch every error in this method:**
>
> **Atoms.** Mn: 1 and 1. O: 4 and 4. H: 8 and 8. Fe: 5 and 5. ✓
>
> **Charge.** Left: $(-1) + (+8) + (+10) = +17$.
> Right: $(+2) + 0 + (+15) = +17$. ✓
>
> A balanced redox equation that balances for atoms but not for charge
> is still wrong, and charge is the check people skip. Do both.
>
> This reaction is the basis of a common titration, and it needs no
> indicator — permanganate is intensely purple and $\ce{Mn^2+}$ is
> nearly colourless, so the first drop of excess titrant colours the
> flask permanently.

**4.** Balance in **basic** solution:
$\ce{MnO4-(aq) + I-(aq) -> MnO2(s) + I2(s)}$

> [!success]- Answer 4
> **The iodide half:**
>
> $\ce{2I- -> I2 + 2e-}$
>
> **The manganese half, balanced for basic conditions.** Oxygen is
> balanced with water on the side needing it and hydroxide on the other:
>
> $\ce{MnO4- + 2H2O + 3e- -> MnO2 + 4OH-}$
>
> Check that half before continuing. Mn: 1 and 1. O: $4 + 2 = 6$ on the
> left, $2 + 4 = 6$ on the right. H: 4 and 4. Charge:
> $-1 - 3 = -4$ on the left, $-4$ on the right. ✓
>
> **Equalise the electrons.** Three and two, so multiply by 2 and 3
> respectively to reach six:
>
> $\begin{aligned} \ce{2MnO4- + 4H2O + 6e-} &\ce{-> 2MnO2 + 8OH-} \\ \ce{6I-} &\ce{-> 3I2 + 6e-} \end{aligned}$
>
> **Add:**
>
> $$\ce{2MnO4-(aq) + 4H2O(l) + 6I-(aq) -> 2MnO2(s) + 8OH-(aq) + 3I2(s)}$$
>
> **Atoms.** Mn: 2 and 2. O: $8 + 4 = 12$ and $4 + 8 = 12$. H: 8 and 8.
> I: 6 and 6. ✓
>
> **Charge.** Left: $(-2) + 0 + (-6) = -8$. Right: $0 + (-8) + 0 = -8$.
> ✓

**5.** Suppose your booklet gives
$E^\circ = +0.34$ V for the copper(II)/copper couple and
$E^\circ = -0.76$ V for the zinc(II)/zinc couple. For a cell built from
these two half-cells, find $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$, identify the anode
and the cathode, and write the cell notation.

**6.** For
$\ce{2Al(s) + 3Cu^2+(aq) -> 2Al^3+(aq) + 3Cu(s)}$,
with $E^\circ = -1.66$ V for the aluminium(III)/aluminium couple and
$E^\circ = +0.34$ V for copper(II)/copper, find
$E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$. A classmate multiplies the aluminium value by 2
and the copper value by 3 before subtracting. What is wrong with that?

> [!success]- Answer 6
> Aluminium is oxidised, so it is the anode; copper(II) is reduced, so
> it is the cathode.
>
> $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} = (+0.34) - (-1.66) = +2.00\ \text{V}$
>
> **$E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = +2.00$ V**, and the coefficients in the
> balanced equation play no part in it at all.

> **Why the classmate's method is wrong.** A potential is an
> **intensive** property — it does not depend on how much material is
> involved. It belongs to the same family as temperature, density, and
> concentration, and not to the family that contains mass, volume, and

**7.** Using $E^\circ = +0.80$ V for the silver(I)/silver couple and
$E^\circ = +0.34$ V for copper(II)/copper, predict whether each of these
happens spontaneously. Give $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ for each.
*(a)* A copper strip placed in silver nitrate solution.
*(b)* A silver strip placed in copper(II) sulfate solution.

> [!success]- Answer 7
> **(a) Copper in silver nitrate.** For this to happen, copper must be
> oxidised — copper is the anode — and silver(I) must be reduced —
> silver is the cathode.
>
> $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = (+0.80) - (+0.34) = +0.46\ \text{V}$
>
> **Positive, so spontaneous.** The copper strip dissolves, silver metal
> deposits on it as a grey fuzz, and the solution turns blue as
> $\ce{Cu^2+}$ builds up.
>
> $\ce{2Ag+(aq) + Cu(s) -> 2Ag(s) + Cu^2+(aq)}$
>
> Note the 2 on the silver — one copper atom supplies two electrons, and
> each silver ion needs one. It does not affect
> $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$, exactly as in question 6.
>
> **(b) Silver in copper(II) sulfate.** Now silver would have to be
> oxidised — silver is the anode — and copper(II) reduced.
>
> $E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = (+0.34) - (+0.80) = -0.46\ \text{V}$
>
> **Negative, so not spontaneous.** Nothing happens. A silver spoon in
> copper sulfate solution stays a silver spoon.

**8.** Four claims from a study group. Correct each.
*(a) "The anode is always the negative electrode."*
*(b) "We doubled the equation, so $E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ doubled."*
*(c) "Reduction happens at the anode, because the anode is where the
electrons come from."*
*(d) "$E^\circ_{\text{cell}}$ is positive, so the reaction will go
quickly."*
