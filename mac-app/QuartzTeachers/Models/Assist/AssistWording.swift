/// Every sentence the assistant says to a teacher about deploying, previewing
/// and agreeing to things — written once, here.
///
/// **Why a table rather than the sentences where they are used.** They were
/// where they were used, and the same sentence existed four times: in the
/// Swift that says it, in the Swift test that pins it, in `GUI-IMPROVEMENTS.md`
/// where it is specified, and in `WINDOWS-HANDOFF.md` where Windows is told to
/// copy it. Three of those four were already drifting — "the output is in that
/// section's console" against "…that section's window", the same failure told
/// two ways depending on which of two functions ran it. A sentence a teacher
/// reads is a specification, and a specification kept in four places is three
/// places to be wrong.
///
/// **Why the parameters are Strings.** `section` is an `Int` everywhere else,
/// and it is a `String` here so the CONTRACT GENERATOR can call these same
/// functions with `{course}` and `{section}` and get the template out. That is
/// the whole trick: the file Windows tests against is produced by running this
/// table, so it cannot describe wording the mac does not actually say.
/// See `AssistContract` and `contracts/README.md`.
///
/// **What belongs here.** Sentences BOTH platforms say — the approval card,
/// the cancels, what a deploy or a preview reports. Not the model's own words,
/// not anything composed from a list (a plan naming eleven pages is written
/// where the pages are known), and nothing platform-specific.
