/// have to make: the mac enforces one assistant window at a time, so it only
/// ever needs a single active session. Windows does not (yet) have that
/// limit — see documentation/13-windows-port-archive.md — so this tracks a SET of open sessions
/// rather than one. What both sides need this for is narrower than the
/// bigger "one at a time" feature: knowing whether ANY assistant window is
/// open, so Settings can refuse to delete a model file out from under a
/// running `llama-server.exe`.
///
/// The bug this exists to stop: a teacher downloads a model, opens the
/// assistant (which spawns a server that has the file open), goes back to
/// Settings and removes that same model. Whether the delete succeeds while
/// the server still has the file open is Windows' own file-sharing rules to
/// decide, not something this app controls — but even where it "works" for
/// the reply already in flight, the model file is gone for the NEXT prompt,
/// a server restart, or a second window. Settings should not offer the
/// button at all while that risk exists.
