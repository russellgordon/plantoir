"""Prints the section fingerprint used by the " — Edited" title-bar marker.

Ported from `SectionPublishState.Fingerprint` (Windows, `.cs`) / the mac's
`SectionPublishState.swift` — see documentation/05-build-pipeline.md, "A scheduled deploy
needs its own path to the same record". Every rule here (which files count,
symlink one-hop resolution, sort order, hash) MUST match those two byte for
byte; this is a wire format, not an implementation detail.

Why this exists as a THIRD copy of the same algorithm, in Python, instead of
being called from C#: a scheduled deploy on Windows runs `schtasks.exe` ->
`powershell.exe` directly, never the app binary, so there is no in-process
C# available at the moment the fingerprint must be taken — right before the
deploy runs, not at the moment the teacher scheduled it (edits made between
scheduling and the overnight run must still show up in the fingerprint, the
same as an interactive deploy). The scheduled task's generated wrapper
script calls this instead, using the app's own bundled Python. Nothing on
the mac calls this file — its launchd agent launches the app binary itself,
so it fingerprints in Swift, in-process, and never needed a Python copy.

Usage:
    python.exe section_fingerprint.py <course_directory> <section_number> [exclude ...]

Excludes are course-relative, forward-slash paths (self-publishing
destinations that land inside the course's own folder) — see
`SectionPublishState.SelfPublishingSubpaths`. Prints the lowercase hex
SHA-256 fingerprint to stdout, and nothing else, on success. Prints nothing
and exits non-zero on failure — a fingerprinting failure must never be
mistaken for an empty-string fingerprint.
