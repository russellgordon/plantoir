/// Reclaims a stopped preview's leftover processes. Ending the launcher
/// alone leaves the serve chain (python → npm exec quartz → node → esbuild)
/// running — idling servers hold node's RAM, and an orphaned mid-flight
/// build burns real CPU until it completes. The working folder's preview
/// launcher carries a --stop mode that ends the section's processes and
/// never starts anything; this runs it and reads back only the count.
///
/// WHICH processes belong to the section is a shared rule, written down once
/// in contracts/shared-rules.json → stopPreview. On this platform they are
/// matched by COMMAND LINE, never by working directory: Win32_Process does
/// not expose a working directory at all. (Both this comment and two places
/// in documentation/03-launcher-scripts.md said "by working directory" until 2026-09-05. That
/// is the mac's mechanism, where the rule reads /proc; it has never been
/// true here, and a wrong sentence about how a kill chooses its targets is
/// exactly the kind that gets believed.)
///
/// The sweep is NOT instantaneous, so a build started for the same section
/// while a sweep is still in flight dies with the processes the sweep was
/// actually after. Anything about to start a build must therefore await
/// <see cref="WaitForStopsToFinish"/> first.
/// The wait is scoped to one section, as on the mac: waiting for every stop
/// everywhere would be safe but would let one window's Stop delay another
/// window's Preview for no reason.
