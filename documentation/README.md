# Technical Documentation

**Two things this folder does NOT hold.** What the two apps must AGREE on is data, in [`contracts/`](../contracts/README.md), because both test suites run it — the sentences the assistant says, the arguments the launchers get, the keys `course_config.json` carries, the image pins. And work still to do is in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/russellgordon/plantoir/issues), labelled `mac` / `windows` / `toolchain` / `assistant`.

What these pages DO hold, as of 2026-09-08, is both halves: how the toolchain works, and WHY — what was chosen, what was rejected, what was measured. That second half arrived when the two handoff documents were absorbed into this folder and deleted, each of their sections landing in the page that owns its subject.

**Work still to do is not here either.** It is in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/russellgordon/plantoir/issues), labelled `mac` / `windows` / `toolchain` / `assistant`. This folder absorbed the two handoff documents on 2026-09-08, and the to-do lists they carried went to issues rather than into these pages.

**Audience:** computer science teachers who want to understand how this toolchain
actually works under the hood — not just how to use it. (For usage instructions,
see the main [README](../README.md); for the workshop walkthrough, see
[archived workshop handout](../archive/PRESENTATION-2025-08.md).)

This documentation explains the purpose, rationale, and mechanism of every part
of the system, including a complete enumeration of the customizations made to
the stock [Quartz v4.5.0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/tree/v4.5.0)
static-site generator.

## Reading order

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Overview & Design Rationale](01-overview.md) | Why this exists, the problems it solves, and the high-level architecture |
| 2 | [The Docker Image](02-docker-image.md) | What is baked into the `teaching-quartz` container and how each machine builds it locally from the recipe |
| 3 | [The Launcher Scripts](03-launcher-scripts.md) | The host-side `setup` / `preview` / `deploy` scripts for macOS and Windows |
| 4 | [Course Setup](04-course-setup.md) | The interactive wizard (`setup_course.py`) and the folder structure it creates |
| 5 | [The Build Pipeline](05-build-pipeline.md) | How `build_site.py` merges content and produces a per-section Quartz site |
| 6 | [Quartz Customizations](06-quartz-customizations.md) | **The complete list** of every change made to stock Quartz v4.5.0, with purpose and mechanism |
| 7 | [Publishing a built section](07-deployment.md) | The three destinations — Netlify (delta deploys against its API), Cloudflare Pages (via wrangler), and a folder on the teacher's own machine |
| 8 | [`course_config.json` Reference](08-course-config-reference.md) | Every key in the per-course configuration file |
| 9 | [The macOS App — Plantoir](09-mac-app.md) | The native GUI (`mac-app/`), how it drives the same scripts, and how it delivers the toolchain itself |
| 10 | [The Local AI Assistant](10-local-ai-assistant.md) | What the on-device model is and how it is configured, with enough background on language models to follow it — and how a typed sentence becomes a Swift function call |
| 11 | [Release Strategy & Production Deployment](11-release-strategy.md) | The packaging, Developer ID code-signing, Apple Notarization, Azure Trusted Signing, Inno Setup, and cross-platform release pipeline |
| 12 | [The Windows App — Plantoir](12-windows-app.md) | The WinUI 3 GUI (`windows-app/`), how it differs from the mac (no container, a native runtime, ConPTY, Credential Manager, Task Scheduler), where it keeps things, the flags it answers, and how its interface is driven by tests |
| 13 | [Archive — the Windows port](13-windows-port-archive.md) | **History, not a specification.** Write-ups for Windows-port work verified shipped as of 2026-08-22, kept for the reasoning. Closed to new entries; where it and a contract disagree, the contract is true |

## The one-paragraph summary

A teacher writes course notes as Markdown files in an
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, organized into *shared* folders (content
common to every section of a course) and *per-section* folders. A Docker
container — which bundles Python, Node.js, and a patched copy of Quartz
v4.5.0 — merges the shared and section content into a single content tree,
applies roughly forty targeted patches to Quartz's configuration and
components (colour scheme, fonts, locale, sidebar behaviour, date handling,
and more, all driven by a per-course `course_config.json`), and builds a
static website. The teacher previews the site locally (the launcher prints
the address — each working folder gets its own port block, so several
sections can preview at once), then deploys it to Netlify using a
hash-based delta upload that only transfers files that actually changed.
Most teachers do all of this through the Plantoir app, which also carries
the toolchain itself into each working folder's `.toolchain/`.
