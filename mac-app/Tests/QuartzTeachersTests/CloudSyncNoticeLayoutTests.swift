/// points tall, and the window's path bar and the sidebar's filter bar slid
/// off the bottom of the screen: a responsive window with its bottom band
/// blank, at every window height. Found by driving the real app; pinned
/// here so it is found by the suite next time.
///
/// It was not found by the suite next time: the same fault shipped twice more
/// in the same window and was caught by hand at the v1.2.0 release smoke
/// (issue #211). `ProgressViewSizeTests` now carries the same measurement for
/// the panels in the detail column, and the failure class is written up in
/// `documentation/09-mac-app.md` → "A blank window: when a child claims a size
/// the window cannot give".
