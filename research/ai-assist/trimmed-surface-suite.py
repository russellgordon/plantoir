"""The TRIMMED surface (AssistAgent.NarrowToLocal), measured.

**The surface was FIFTEEN tools when this ran on 2026-08-14, and is thirteen
now** — `AssistAgent.ForTheLocalModel` dropped four `plan_` tools and gained
`read_remembered_timetable` and `add_next_class` on 2026-08-17 (4089c752).
The results below are of the fifteen and are sound; `narrow-tools.py` will
hand this suite THIRTEEN today, so a re-run is not comparable to them
without saying so.

Answers the question HISTORY.md part 2 section 6.1 left open: did the
TEACHERS SAY phrasings and the trim fix the 69%? Measured 2026-08-14
(results in trimmed-surface-results.txt): 91% bare, 94% with the two fixes
this suite can toggle, zero polarity inversions throughout.

The toggles exist because each one was earned:

  --date-appended    "(Today is ...)" on the END of the user message. Without
                     it every "tomorrow" became the schema's example date
                     (2023-09-15, in 2026). PREPENDED the same line cost 15
                     points of routing, so the position is the finding.
  --date-prepended   The version that failed, kept so the failure can be
                     reproduced rather than re-discovered.
  --real-course      Schema examples say the window's course instead of
                     "for example ICS3U". Without it, a request naming no
                     course copied ICS3U out of the examples 9/9 times.

The shipped configuration is --date-appended --real-course, which is what
AssistAgent does (Say appends the date; NarrowToLocal rewrites examples).

Usage:
  python trimmed-surface-suite.py TOOLS.json [trials] [--date-appended]
         [--date-prepended] [--real-course] [--port 8099]

TOOLS.json is the narrowed OpenAI-shaped surface - produce it with
dump-tools.ps1 (raw tools/list) piped through narrow-tools.py.
