// Prints the window number of an application's window.
//
// `screencapture -l <window-number>` grabs THAT WINDOW's own contents,
// whatever is in front of it and wherever it sits — which a region capture
// cannot do. A region capture photographs a rectangle of the screen, so a
// window that had not finished coming to the front produced a screenshot of
// whatever was behind it. That happened, and the result was a picture of a
// terminal filed as a class website.
//
// With expected bounds, the window whose frame best matches is chosen —
// and nothing is printed if no window comes close. Without them, the
// largest ordinary window wins. Bounds are not optional decoration: the
// largest-window rule once photographed the developer's own logged-in
// Netlify dashboard and filed it as three class websites, because his
// browser window was bigger than the harness's.
//
// Usage: swift windowid.swift "Safari" [x y width height]
//        swift windowid.swift --list "Notification Center"
//
// `--list` prints EVERY on-screen window of that owner, any layer, one per
// line as "number x y width height layer". It exists for the notification
// banner (capture.py, the notification-banner scene): a banner is not a
// layer-0 window and its bounds are not known in advance, so it is found by
// polling this list for a window that was not there a moment ago.
