What is wrong with a course's folders, in words a teacher can act on.

Certain folder and file names carry behaviour — the curriculum folder, the
folder holding class pages, `Media`, a section's `index.md` — and nothing
stopped a teacher deleting or renaming one in Obsidian or the Finder. The
features then failed SILENTLY. The Curriculum Coverage map is the worst of
them: it still rendered, still looked healthy, and was wrong.

**Why this lives here and not in the apps.** Every check is defined over the
MERGED content tree, which does not exist until a build makes it — so there is
nothing for a check to look at before the run. And a check that only guarded
the GUI button would be bypassed by the assistant, by `Plantoir --mcp-stdio`,
by the launchers, and by the scheduled deploy, which runs from launchd or Task
Scheduler with the app CLOSED and is the case that matters most.

**Every check asks whether the FEATURE produced anything**, never whether a
folder exists. Recreating an empty `Ontario Curriculum` folder does not restore
a teacher's expectation pages — `_find_curriculum_folder` wants a page named
for an expectation code — so an existence check with a Fix button would have
silenced the warning AND left the map missing. A check that can be satisfied
without fixing the problem is worse than no check at all.

The words themselves are NOT written here. They come from
`contracts/shared-rules.json` -> `siteHealth.checks`, so the two apps and this
module cannot word the same problem differently, and so a sentence a teacher
reads has one home like every other sentence in this product.
