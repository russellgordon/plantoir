#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# verify-deploy.sh — every destination, and every primary+secondary pairing,
# published for real and then fetched back.
#
# WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM verify.sh
# ===================================
# `verify.sh` is the gate: it must be runnable at any moment, on any machine,
# without credentials and without touching anything outside this repository.
# This one cannot be. It needs a Netlify token, a Cloudflare token and a
# Cloudflare account ID, it needs the network, and it CREATES REAL SITES on
# real accounts. So it is opt-in, run deliberately, and never wired into the
# gate. Run it when the publishing path changes — and publishing has now
# broken twice in ways nothing else caught.
#
# WHAT IT IS GUARDING AGAINST, SPECIFICALLY
# =========================================
# Both of these shipped, and neither was caught by a unit test or by verify.sh:
#
#   * A preview build reaching a published site. Serve mode bakes a live-reload
#     client into every page; on a published site that script makes a student's
#     browser ask permission to "access other apps and services on this
#     device". `deploy.py` refuses it — but only for Netlify and Cloudflare,
#     because publishing to a FOLDER never enters the container. Measured
#     2026-09-05 at 230 of 244 files.
#   * A publish that reported success and copied NOTHING, because the container
#     writes through a bind mount whose contents the host cannot see yet.
#
# Both are invisible to any check that does not publish and then LOOK at what
# came out. That is this script's whole job: it fetches every published site
# back and reads it.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, AND WHY THAT IS HONEST
# ==============================================
# `additional_deploy_targets` is not handled by `deploy.sh` at all — the APP
# loops over the destinations and calls the launcher once per destination.
# So this script exercises the pairings the way the app does, by running the
# same sequence of launcher calls, which is a real test of the launcher half.
# That the APP produces exactly those argument lists is a separate question,
# already pinned by `contracts/app-rules.json` → `deployArguments` and run by
# both suites. Between the two, the pairing is covered end to end; neither
# half covers it alone, and this comment exists so nobody assumes otherwise.
#
# USAGE
#   ./verify-deploy.sh                     # uses the defaults below
#   ./verify-deploy.sh <folder> <CODE> <N>
#
# It uses ONE course throughout, on purpose: a Netlify site and a Cloudflare
# project are created once and reused, rather than littering the accounts with
# one per case. The names are printed at the end so they can be deleted.
