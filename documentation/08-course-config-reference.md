# 8. `course_config.json` Reference

[◀ Previous: Deployment](07-deployment.md) · [Back to index](README.md) · [Next: The macOS App ▶](09-mac-app.md)

`courses/<CODE>/course_config.json` is the single source of truth for a
course. It is **written** by the setup wizard
([`setup_course.py`](04-course-setup.md)), **read and auto-extended** by the
build ([`build_site.py`](05-build-pipeline.md) appends newly discovered
folders/files), and **statically imported** by the patched Explorer
components at Quartz build time
([customizations C2-1](06-quartz-customizations.md#c2-applied-on-every-build)).

A representative example:

```json
{
  "course_code": "ICS3U",
  "course_name": "Introduction to Computer Science",
  "custom_short_name": "",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "emojis": { "sections": { "section1": "🖥️", "section3": "🔬" } },
  "num_sections": 2,
  "section_numbers": [1, 3],
  "shared_folders": ["Concepts", "Examples", "Exercises", "Ontario Curriculum", "Tutorials"],
  "shared_files": ["Learning Goals.md"],
  "per_section_folders": ["All Classes"],
  "per_section_files": ["Key Links.md"],
  "hidden": ["Ontario Curriculum", "Learning Goals.md", "Media"],
  "expandable": ["Concepts", "Examples", "Exercises", "Tutorials"],
  "expandOnFolderClick": false,
  "footer_html": "…licence notice…",
  "show_reading_time": false,
  "fonts": {
    "default": { "header": "Montserrat", "body": "Lora", "code": "JetBrains Mono" },
    "sections": { "section1": { "header": "Montserrat", "body": "Lora", "code": "JetBrains Mono" } }
  },
  "show_section_marker": { "sections": { "section1": true, "section3": false } },
  "show_grade_in_title": { "sections": { "section1": true, "section3": false } },
  "color_schemes": { "section1": "nordic-frost", "section3": "mlb-toronto-blue-jays" },
  "custom_domains": { "sections": { "section1": { "netlify": "ics3u.myschool.ca" } } }
}
```

## Key-by-key

| Key | Type | Written by | Consumed by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `course_code` | string | setup | build | Uppercased code, e.g. `ICS3U`. The 4th character, if a digit, encodes grade (1→9 … 4→12) and selects "course mode"; a non-digit (e.g. `CODING`) selects "club mode". |
| `course_name` | string | setup | setup (starting titles) + build (computed landing title, every build) | Human name. The build recomputes each section's landing title from it every time, so renames reach the site. |
| `custom_short_name` | string | setup (club mode only) | build | ≤ 12-char label shown beside the header emoji instead of the course code. Empty → fall back to title-cased code. |
| `locale` | string | setup | build → `quartz.config.ts` | One of Quartz's 27 locale codes; drives UI strings ([teacher-customized](06-quartz-customizations.md#d-locale-files-replaced-at-build-time)) and date formats. |
| `emojis.sections.section<N>` | string | setup | build (page title) | Single emoji per section, e.g. `"📚"`. Legacy `emojis.default` is honoured as a fallback. |
| `num_sections` | int | setup | setup (prompt default) + build and launchers (fallback when `section_numbers` is absent) | Count of sections; normalized to `len(section_numbers)`. |
| `section_numbers` | int[] | setup | launchers + build (validation) | The teacher's actual timetable section numbers, e.g. `[1,3,4]`. Only these sections can be built or deployed. |
| `shared_folders` | string[] | setup + build discovery | build | Course-root folders copied into every section's site. `Media` never appears here (symlinked instead). |
| `shared_files` | string[] | setup + build discovery | build | Course-root loose `.md` files copied into every section's site. |
| `per_section_folders` | string[] | setup + build discovery | build | Folder names expected inside each `section<N>/`, copied only into that section's site. |
| `per_section_files` | string[] | setup + build discovery | build | Loose `.md` files inside each `section<N>/`. |
| `hidden` | string[] | setup + build (auto-adds `Media`) | build → Explorer omit set | Items filtered out of the sidebar. Still built, linkable, and searchable. |
| `expandable` | string[] | setup + build discovery | patched Explorer (statically imported) | Folders rendered as collapsible trees; all other folders render as plain links to their index page. |
| `expandOnFolderClick` | bool | setup | build → `folderClickBehavior` + `data-expand-on-navigate` | `true`: clicking a folder name expands it. `false` (default): name navigates; only the chevron expands. |
| `footer_html` | string | setup | build → `Footer.tsx` | Raw HTML injected into every page's footer. |
| `show_reading_time` | bool | setup | build → `ContentMeta.tsx` | Show "N min read" on pages. |
| `fonts.default` / `fonts.sections.section<N>` | object | setup | build → `quartz.config.ts` typography | `header`, `body`, `code` font family names (Google Fonts or system stacks). Section entry wins over default. |
| `show_section_marker.sections.section<N>` | bool | setup | build (page title + computed landing title) | Whether the header shows `S<N>` and the computed landing title carries ", Section N". The build also accepts several legacy shapes (plain bool, flat map, alternate key names). |
| `show_grade_in_title.sections.section<N>` | bool (default `true`) | app (per-section settings) — the wizard never writes it, it only honours an existing value when generating a section's starting `index.md` title | build (computed landing title) | Whether the landing title leads with the grade ("Grade 11 …"). Deliberately literal — the switch alone decides; the app shows an orange warning when the name already contains the grade label. A legacy course-wide bool is honoured. |
| `color_schemes.section<N>` | string | setup | build → `quartz.config.ts` colors + social card | Scheme id from `support/colour_schemes.json` (43 available). The section's social sharing card is drawn in this scheme too. |
| `custom_domains.sections.section<N>` | object (per-destination-type map, e.g. `{"netlify": "…", "cloudflare_pages": "…"}`) | app (Advanced, per-section settings — one field per configured destination) | app (published-site links, per destination) + `build_site.py` (baseUrl, via the PRIMARY destination's own entry only — one build's sitemap/RSS/social-card links can only follow one domain) | The teacher's own domain for ONE destination of the section's published site. Links after a deploy swap that destination's own host for it (path preserved, https) — never another destination's. An OLDER shape (a bare string, from before a course could have more than one destination) is still read, as the domain for whichever destination is currently primary (`deploy_target`). The domain itself must already be configured with that host (Netlify/Cloudflare Pages) — this key only changes what Plantoir LINKS to. Entries are normalized (scheme and path stripped) on the way in. |
| `prepopulate_example_content` | bool | setup | setup (remembered on a re-run) | Whether the teacher took the ready-made payload for this course code. |
| `use_skeleton` | bool | setup | setup (remembered on a re-run) | Whether the teacher took the subject skeleton instead. Mutually exclusive with the key above — a course gets one starting content source or neither. |
| `include_curriculum_pages` | bool | setup | setup | Whether the curriculum folder was installed. Declining it strips the `%%curriculum-start%%`…`%%curriculum-end%%` passages from every payload page and unlinks inline expectation references. |
| `include_curriculum_coverage` | bool (default `true`) | setup | build | Whether the generated `Curriculum Coverage` map page is produced. |
| `curriculum_folder` | string or null | setup | build | What this course calls the folder holding one page per expectation. Declared by every payload and skeleton manifest. The build tries it FIRST and only then falls back to scanning for a top-level folder whose name contains `curriculum` — which is still the path a from-scratch course takes, but would never have found a folder called something else entirely. |
| `class_folder` | string or null | setup, and a rename in Course Settings | build, both apps | Which per-section folder holds this course's class pages. **Absent falls back to the GUESS** — the first per-section folder whose name contains `class`, else the first, else the literal `All Classes` — which is what every course made before 2026-09-01 relies on. The key exists because the guess quietly decided what a teacher was allowed to CALL the folder: somebody whose vocabulary is "Thread 2, Day 3" would sensibly call it `All Days`, and the guess would then point the next-class button and the coverage map at whatever folder happened to be first. **A rename writes this key even on a course that never had one**, because a rename is the one moment Plantoir witnesses the change. A stale name loses to the guess; a name differing only in case yields the folder LIST's spelling, because file paths are built from the answer. |
| `unit_word` | string | setup (new courses only) | build, both apps | What this course calls the first half of a class page's name — `Unit 2, Day 3`, or `Module 2, Day 3`. **Absent means `Unit`**, and so does an empty string; unlike `graded_folders`, the two are not distinguished, because there is no sensible reading of "the teacher cleared the word". Chosen when the course is made, and nowhere else: the ready-made pages are written in that word as they are poured, and renaming a course already in use is a separate and far more dangerous piece of work (see `TODO.md`). `Day` is deliberately fixed. |
| `excluded_items` | object with `shared` and/or `per_section` arrays | Course Settings | build | Folder and file names the teacher removed in Settings, kept out of previews and deploys. **Authoritative at build time**: preflight drops an excluded name it finds back in the folder lists rather than re-adding it, and never un-hides it. Keyed by scope because the same bare name can legitimately exist in both, and the two are found by different scans. An exclusion does NOT expire when the folder is deleted and re-created — discovery is name-based, so the build cannot tell "the folder I excluded" from "the new folder I just made". |
| `graded_folders` | array of strings | setup, and the Marks checklist in Course Settings | build, both apps | The folders whose work counts for marks, which is what makes an expectation "assessed" on the coverage map. **Absent is not empty.** Absent means the teacher has never been asked, so the historical rule applies (any folder whose name contains `task`) and an existing course keeps exactly the marks it had; `[]` means they were asked and cleared it. Seeding existing courses would not have been safe — the mathematics skeleton ships `Thinking Tasks`, which the old rule counted and a pool of `["Tasks"]` does not. **The first tick FREEZES the pool**: the moment a teacher touches the checklist, the key is written with everything the course was already counting, and the historical rule stops applying to it. Which is why what the checklist OFFERS matters as much as what it writes — the build matches a folder at any depth, so the apps offer the two folder lists plus every folder found inside the course, four levels deep. That rule, its skip list and what it deliberately leaves out are in [`contracts/shared-rules.json`](../contracts/shared-rules.json) → `gradedFolders.choices`. |
| `include_coverage_notes` | bool (default `true`) | setup | build | Whether that page carries its explanatory sections ("What counts", "Reading it honestly") or the map alone. |
| `use_lcs_terminology` | bool | setup | setup (starting folder and file names) | A school-specific mode: swaps the factory shared-folder and shared-file lists for one school's own words — "College Board Curriculum", "SIC Drop-In Sessions.md" and "Grove Time.md" in place of "Extra Help.md". Affects the names a new course starts with, nothing after that. |

### Publishing destination

| Key | Type | Written by | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deploy_target` | string (default `netlify`) | app only (Course Settings → Publishing; the wizard preserves it but never writes it) | the app, which translates it into the launcher's `--target cloudflare` / `--to-folder <path>` flags — neither the launcher nor `deploy.py` reads the key | Where this course's sections publish: `netlify`, `cloudflare_pages`, or `local_folder`. Absent means `netlify`, so every existing course keeps working untouched. See [deployment](07-deployment.md). |
| `deploy_folder_path` | string | app (Publishing, folder mode) | the app, which passes it as `--to-folder <path>`; the launcher does the host-side copy from that flag | Only for `local_folder`: the folder sections are mirrored into, one `sectionN` subfolder each. Validated live in the app — a missing, unwritable, or file-not-folder path blocks Save rather than failing at publish time. |
| `additional_deploy_targets` | array of `{type, path}` objects | app (Publishing, "Also publish to, for redundancy") | the app — currently config/UI only; nothing yet triggers a second deploy from it (see below) | Extra destinations this course ALSO publishes to, beyond `deploy_target` (the primary), for redundancy against one host having a bad day. `type` uses the same spellings as `deploy_target`; `path` is only present for a `local_folder` entry. **Absent entirely** (never written as `[]`) for the overwhelming majority of courses that have not opted in, so an untouched course writes the exact same file it always has. At most one entry per known type, and never a type that is already the primary — `CourseConfiguration.deployTarget`'s own setter enforces this, dropping a type from this list the moment it becomes the primary. |

**Keys the wizard does not own survive a re-run.** `setup_course.py` builds
the config it owns, then copies through every key already in the saved file
that it did not write — the app's publishing choice, and anything a future
version adds. Without that, re-running the wizard on an existing course would
silently drop settings made in the app.

The Cloudflare **account ID** is deliberately *not* here: it identifies the
teacher rather than the course, so it lives in the app's own settings (and,
for direct launcher use, the OS credential store) and is entered once for
every course. The API tokens for Netlify and Cloudflare never touch this
file — or any file in the working folder.

## Files that travel alongside it

| Path (under `courses/`) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<CODE>/course_config.backup.json` | Automatic backup written before build-time discovery updates the config. |
| `<CODE>/.merged_output` | **A shortcut, not a folder** (since 2026-09-05): it points at `~/Library/Application Support/Plantoir/builds/<folder id>/<CODE>` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plantoir\builds\<folder id>\<CODE>` on Windows. Built sites are derived and were moved out so that copying, zipping, backing up or syncing a course no longer carries them. Safe to delete; rebuilt on demand. |
| `<CODE>/.merged_output/section<N>/` | The section's built site as every script names it — `public/` and a copy of `course_config.json`. NOT the Quartz scaffold or `node_modules`: those live on the container's own fast storage and are never mirrored out. |
| `<CODE>/.netlify_sites/section<N>.json` | Netlify site marker (site id/URL) so re-deploys target the same site. |
| `<CODE>/.cloudflare_sites/section<N>.json` | Cloudflare Pages marker (project name/id, subdomain, account) so re-publishing reuses the same project instead of creating a second one. |
| `<CODE>/Media/` | Shared binary assets; symlinked into every build, always hidden from the sidebar. |
| `<CODE>/.obsidian/` | Obsidian vault settings (seeded from `support/obsidian_defaults`). |
| `_backups/<CODE>/<timestamp>.zip` | Full course backups made by the setup wizard before re-runs. |
| `.internal/profile.json` | Teacher profile (last name for Netlify site naming). |
| `.gitignore` | Auto-maintained to exclude `.internal/` and `_backups/`. |

## Frontmatter conventions recognized in content

These are read from individual Markdown files rather than the config, but
belong in the same mental model:

| Frontmatter key | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `publishForSection<N>` / `createdSection<N>` | shared content | Per-section publication state; collapsed to `publish`/`created` when building section N ([mechanism](05-build-pipeline.md#frontmatter-processing)). |
| `publish` | any page | `false` keeps the page out of the built site. Anything else — including no key at all — publishes it. |
| `created` | any page | The displayed and sort date ([C1-3](06-quartz-customizations.md#c1-applied-on-first-build--full-rebuild)). |
| `draft` / `draftSection<N>` | any page | **Legacy, still read.** The same idea with the opposite polarity (`draft: true` hides). Used only when no `publish` key is present. Editing such a page's visibility rewrites the key to `publish` / `publishForSection<N>` on the same line and removes the old one (decided 2026-09-07; `contracts/file-formats.json` → `pageVisibility.writingRules`). The build reads both spellings either way. |
| `renderFolderPages: false` | a folder's `index.md` | Suppresses the auto-generated file listing on that folder page ([A3](06-quartz-customizations.md#a3-foldercontenttsx-folder-listing-page)). |
| `excludeBacklinks: true` | any page | Hides the "When did we do this?" backlinks panel on that page ([D1](06-quartz-customizations.md#d1-patched-backlinkstsx-supportbacklinkstsx)). |
| `transcludeTitleSize: h2` | a transcluded page | Heading level used for the page's title when embedded via `![[…]]` ([C1-10](06-quartz-customizations.md#c1-applied-on-first-build--full-rebuild)). |
