"""Take every screenshot plantoir.app uses, without anyone touching a mouse.

Run it from the top of the repository::

    python3 website/shots/capture.py            # everything
    python3 website/shots/capture.py --app      # just the app windows
    python3 website/shots/capture.py --sites    # just the class websites

What it does, in order:

1. **Provisions a demo working folder** (``~/Teaching`` by default) by driving
   the app's own new-course panel for ENG2D, MCV4U and SCH3U -- three subjects
   chosen so the class sites between them show prose, typeset mathematics and
   chemistry. Skipped when the courses are already there.
2. **Builds and publishes** each of those sections, so the address bar in a
   screenshot reads like a real class site rather than like localhost.
3. **Photographs the app** by running the marketing UI tests, once with the
   Mac in light appearance and once in dark.
4. **Photographs the class sites** in Safari, and on an iPhone in the
   Simulator, again in both appearances.
5. **Rebuilds the site** so the new images are in the pages.

Everything it borrows, it puts back: the Mac's appearance, the app's
remembered window size, the frontmost application, and any Safari window it
opened. It also holds off sleep while it runs, so a capture started at night
survives the displays going dark -- though the Mac itself must stay awake and
unlocked.
