# --non-interactive is looked for HERE, before the main parser below, for the
# same reason deploy.sh pre-scans for it: the first question this script asks —
# the 'Open' course-code guard — comes before that parser. The parser also
# accepts the flag, so it is not reported as an unknown option; this only makes

#
# preview.sh needs this even though it publishes nothing, because a SCHEDULED
# publish builds before it publishes and the mac's launchd agent runs
# `preview.sh --build-only` directly (ScheduledDeploy.oneShotCommand). Without
# it this script has no `set -e`: the read fails at end of input, `_ans` stays

# >>> BUILD OUTPUT BLOCK >>> — identical in setup.sh, preview.sh and
# deploy.sh, and extracted between these two markers by
# scripts/test_build_output_link.sh, which runs the real thing against the
# states an existing teacher's folder can be in. Keep the markers, and keep
# the three copies the same.
# ---- Built websites live OUTSIDE this folder -------------------------
# A built site is DERIVED: every file in it comes from the teacher's notes
# and can be made again. It used to be written to
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output, INSIDE the working folder — where a cloud
# service uploads every build and charges it to the teacher's quota, Time
# Machine backs it up, a zip or a Finder copy carries it, and Get Info
# counts it. It lives here instead, for EVERY working folder rather than
# only the synced ones: the benefit is not confined to syncing, and one
# code path is one code path.
#
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output becomes a SYMLINK to this folder, so every
# script, every scheduled publish and every teacher at the command line
# still names the same path and still finds the site. Under $HOME on
# purpose: the container VM mounts only the home folder, so a builds
# folder anywhere else would appear EMPTY inside the container and every
# build would seem to vanish. It is bind-mounted into the container at the
# SAME absolute path, so the link resolves to the same place on both sides.
#
# The identical rule is in the app (BuildOutputLocation.swift) and written
# down in contracts/shared-rules.json -> buildOutputLocation. It is here as
# well because a teacher at the command line, and a publish scheduled with
# launchd, have no app to do it for them.
# ${HOME%/} rather than $HOME: a trailing slash would make this path differ
# from the one Docker stores (it cleans a mount destination), and the "does
# this container have the builds mount" check below would then be false on
# every run and recreate the container every time.

# 'teaching-quartz:src-*' tags are ever considered, never a blanket prune, and
# any tag a container still references is left alone. Removing one of these
# costs a rebuild and not data — the recipe is bundled — so the only real risk
# is touching somebody else's image, which is what the filters are for.
