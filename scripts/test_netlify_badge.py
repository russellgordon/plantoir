"""
Unit tests for netlify_badge.py in isolation.

Pure stdlib, no Docker and no network. scripts/test_deploy_netlify_headers.py
already exercises this logic thoroughly through `deploy`'s re-export (and
must keep doing so, since that is what the two apps' callers actually use),
but netlify_badge.py is now imported directly by a second caller
(website/netlify_deploy.py) and deserves its own coverage that does not go
through deploy.py at all — so a change to deploy.py's re-export, or a future
caller that imports netlify_badge.py some other way, is caught here rather
than only where deploy.py happens to be exercised. Run with:

        stayed empty on a real Netlify deploy while Cloudflare (no CSP at

        stay absent regardless, since that is the one keyword Netlify's own
        badge needs to render at all — the two are independent CSP keywords,
