    // not of this runner, so nothing reaps it on the way out.
    // `tearDown` does — `reapStubPreviewServer()`.
    //
    // Be precise about what that covers, because the obvious reading is
    // wrong: it catches a server that outlived the TEST BODY (the test
    // failed before it could stop the preview, or stop mode did not
    // fire). It does NOT catch an INTERRUPTED run — Cmd-period, or
    // `xcodebuild` killed — because `tearDown` never executes, and the
    // recorded pid is stranded in a `cq4t-fixture-<UUID>` folder that
    // `FixtureWorkspace.materialize()` will never hand out again, so no
    // later run can even find it. What makes an interrupted run harmless
    // is the port, not the reaper: the orphan holds a kernel-assigned
    // port nobody is waiting for, instead of the 8081 a real preview
    // needs.
    //
    // Do NOT reach for `Process` here, however obvious it looks. An
    // earlier attempt put `pkill -f "http.server 8081"` in
    // `setUp`/`tearDown`; it looked right and did nothing, because the
    // UI-test runner is sandboxed and cannot spawn a child process at
    // all. Verified 2026-08-23 by having the helper write a marker file
    // after `process.waitUntilExit()` — the marker was never written,
    // and the `try?` had been swallowing the failure silently. Whatever
    // reaps that server has to do it WITHOUT spawning anything, which is
    // why the reaper is a raw `kill()` on a pid the stub records.
    //
    // The stub also no longer asks for port 8081, or any fixed port. It
    // binds port 0, lets the kernel choose a free one, and announces the
    // result on the line `ScriptRunner.previewAddress` already scrapes,
    // so the app follows it wherever it lands. A fixed port made this
    // suite fail whenever ANYTHING else on the machine held 8081 — an
    // orphan from an interrupted run one morning, an unrelated `ssh -L`
    // tunnel another — and that failure reads like a broken toolchain
    // rather than like a busy port.
