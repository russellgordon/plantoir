/// own backups already knew to skip it by name. Everything outside Plantoir
/// did not. A synced folder uploads every build to the cloud and charges it
/// against the teacher's quota; Time Machine backs it up; Finder's Get Info
/// counts it; a teacher who zips their folder to hand to a colleague carries
/// it. Windows moved its build output out for exactly this reason
/// (`PLANTOIR_BUILD_ROOT`), and this is the mac's half.

/// **It is done for EVERY working folder, not only synced ones.** The benefit
/// is not confined to syncing — a backup, a copy and a folder size are all
/// smaller for it — and one code path is one code path: a rule that applied
/// only to folders Plantoir believes are synced would be a rule tested in one
/// case and running in another.

/// rather than the path being computed everywhere. Three launchers, three Swift
/// readers, a launchd deploy and a teacher at the command line all name that
/// path today; the link means every one of them keeps working, resolves to the
/// same place, and cannot disagree about where the build went. The launchers
/// bind-mount the builds folder into the container at the SAME absolute path,
/// so the link resolves identically inside and out.
