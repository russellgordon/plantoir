Suppress Netlify's own "Powered by Netlify" ad badge on a built site.

Netlify can inject its own badge (and a matching pre-launch toolbar) into
any public site on a free-tier project — see
https://docs.netlify.com/manage/projects/powered-by-netlify-badge/. There
is no API field to turn it off (its own OpenAPI spec has nothing named
"badge" anywhere on the Site object), and asking every teacher to find the
toggle in their own Netlify dashboard, per section, forever, is not a real
fix. Netlify's docs name the one lever that IS automatic: the badge only
renders through an inline <script> injected at their edge, and a
Content-Security-Policy whose script-src omits 'unsafe-inline' makes the
browser refuse to run it — "Neither the badge nor the pre-launch toolbar
appears, and no other project functionality is affected."

The risk with a blanket policy like that is breaking a site's OWN inline
scripts. Rather than hand-maintain a fixed allow-list (which would go
stale the moment Quartz changes its bundling, or miss a teacher who embeds
a <script> of their own), this scans the actual built HTML at deploy time
and allows exactly what is really there, by content hash. That is a
behaviour, not a fixed list — it holds even if Quartz's own scripts change
on a version bump, and it does not depend on knowing in advance what a
teacher chose to embed.

'unsafe-eval' is included deliberately, and is a SEPARATE keyword from the
'unsafe-inline' this whole policy exists to omit — Netlify's badge needs
'unsafe-inline' specifically ("the script runs in an inline frame"), so
adding 'unsafe-eval' does not let it back in. It has to be there anyway:
Quartz's own Explorer sidebar (patches/explorer.inline.ts) builds its
sort/filter/map functions from `data-data-fns` JSON via
`new Function("return " + source)()` — a `new Function` call is exactly
what 'unsafe-eval' governs. Without it, every page's sidebar silently
stayed empty on Netlify (Cloudflare, with no CSP at all, was unaffected) —
found by A/B testing the two deploy targets side by side and reading the
real `unhandledrejection` the browser threw: "Refused to evaluate a string
as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' ... is not an allowed source of
script." The three inline scripts this module hash-allows all checked out
fine; the break was in vendored Quartz code this policy never touched
directly, which is why hash-checking each inline script's content missed
it — the violation was a *capability* (eval), not a script identity.

Extracted from scripts/deploy.py so both it and website/netlify_deploy.py
(the plantoir.app marketing site's own Netlify deploy, which is exposed to
the identical badge) can share one implementation instead of two copies
drifting apart. See documentation/07-deployment.md, "Suppressing Netlify's own ad badge
(entry 300)", for the full design writeup and the two rejected alternatives.
