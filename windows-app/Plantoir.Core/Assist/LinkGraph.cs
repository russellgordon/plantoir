/// <summary>
/// Every page of one section and what links to what, built once.
///
/// This exists to answer the question a teacher actually asks — *what will
/// students be able to see?* — which link-following alone cannot. Two things
/// go wrong with a rule that just follows links from class pages:
///
/// * **Depth.** A class links to a Concept; the Concept links to the
///   curriculum expectations behind it. Publishing one hop leaves the second
///   hop hidden, so a published page points at a page that is not there.
///   Measured on the sample course: 65 pages one hop from a class, **42 more
///   at two or three hops**.
/// * **Orphans.** Quartz publishes every page that is not a draft and lists it
///   in the explorer, whether anything links to it or not. **50 course-level
///   pages in the sample course are reachable from no class at all** — a whole
///   unit written ahead. No link rule will ever find them.
///
/// So rather than silently following links further (which is safe when
/// publishing and dangerous when hiding — each extra hop can swallow a page
/// some still-published class depends on), the graph is used to CHECK the
/// state a change would produce, and to report what is unreachable. The
/// teacher decides; the tool does the arithmetic.
