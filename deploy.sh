# the macOS app; the trailing newline from pwd is part of the hashed

# >>> BUILD OUTPUT BLOCK >>> — identical in setup.sh, preview.sh and
# deploy.sh, and extracted between these two markers by
# scripts/test_build_output_link.sh, which runs the real thing against the
# states an existing teacher's folder can be in. Keep the markers, and keep
# the three copies the same.
# ---- Built websites live OUTSIDE this folder -------------------------
# A built site is DERIVED: every file in it comes from the teacher's notes
# and can be made again. It used to be written to
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output, INSIDE the working folder — where a cloud
# service uploads every build and charges it to the teacher's quota, Time
# Machine backs it up, a zip or a Finder copy carries it, and Get Info
# counts it. It lives here instead, for EVERY working folder rather than
# only the synced ones: the benefit is not confined to syncing, and one
# code path is one code path.
#
# courses/<CODE>/.merged_output becomes a SYMLINK to this folder, so every
# script, every scheduled publish and every teacher at the command line
# still names the same path and still finds the site. Under $HOME on
# purpose: the container VM mounts only the home folder, so a builds
# folder anywhere else would appear EMPTY inside the container and every
# build would seem to vanish. It is bind-mounted into the container at the
# SAME absolute path, so the link resolves to the same place on both sides.
#
# The identical rule is in the app (BuildOutputLocation.swift) and written
# down in contracts/shared-rules.json -> buildOutputLocation. It is here as
# well because a teacher at the command line, and a publish scheduled with
# launchd, have no app to do it for them.
# ${HOME%/} rather than $HOME: a trailing slash would make this path differ
# from the one Docker stores (it cleans a mount destination), and the "does
# this container have the builds mount" check below would then be false on
# every run and recreate the container every time.

Examples:
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --diagnose
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --team my-org-slug
  ${SELF_CMD} ICS3U 1 --target cloudflare

Notes:
- Deploys from /teaching/courses/<COURSE>/.merged_output/section<SECTION> inside the container.
- You must build first (the static site goes to 'public/' in that section folder).
- --target chooses where the built site goes: netlify (the default) or cloudflare.
- With --to-folder <path>, the site is published to <path>/section<N> on THIS
  computer instead of Netlify — an incremental copy (only changed files move),
  for teachers who upload to their own web host (e.g. over SFTP).
- The Netlify Personal Access Token (PAT) is stored in the macOS Keychain and injected securely at runtime.
  Netlify and Cloudflare tokens live under separate Keychain entries, so keeping both is fine.
- A Cloudflare token needs one permission: Account - Cloudflare Pages - Edit.
  The account is discovered from the token when it can be; --account supplies it
  when it cannot (a token scoped only to Pages cannot list its own account).
- Use --reset-token (or --logout) to remove the saved PAT and re-link on next run;
  combine it with --target cloudflare to clear the Cloudflare one instead.
- --image REF publishes using a particular already-built image; normally the
  image is built locally from this folder's recipe when missing.
- If your course code ends with '0' (zero), you'll be prompted to correct it to 'O' for Open-level courses.

One more thing from Cloudflare.

The token you just made is allowed to publish, but not to look up which
Cloudflare account it belongs to — so the account's ID is needed as well.
This is the only time you will be asked for it.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com
  2. Choose "Workers & Pages" from the list on the left.
  3. Find "Account ID" on the right-hand side, and copy it.
     (It is also the long code in the address bar, just after
     dash.cloudflare.com/.)

    echo "❌ That doesn’t look like an Account ID (it should be 32 letters and digits)."

Connect to Cloudflare.

Cloudflare hosts this section's website for free, and it needs to know that
the publishing is coming from you. It does that with an API token — a long
code that acts like a password made just for this app. Creating one takes
about two minutes, and you will not be asked again: it is saved securely on
this computer.

  1. Open this page:  https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
     (Sign in if you are asked to.)
  2. Choose "Create Token", then "Create Custom Token".
  3. Name it something you will recognise later, such as "Class websites".
  4. Give it ONE permission, chosen from the three dropdowns:
     Account  ->  Cloudflare Pages  ->  Edit
  5. Under "Account Resources", choose "Include" and then your own account
     by name. A token that names no account cannot publish anything, and
     what you get back if you skip this does not mention accounts at all.
  6. Under "TTL", set the end date to after the end of your school year —
     next July is a safe choice — or leave it with no end date. An expired
     token stops your publishing working, with nothing to say why.
  7. Choose "Continue to summary", then "Create Token".
  8. Copy the long code Cloudflare shows you — it is only shown once — and
     paste it below. Nothing appears as you paste; that is normal.

Connect to Netlify.

Netlify hosts this section's website for free, and it needs to know that the
publishing is coming from you. It does that with an access token — a long
code that acts like a password made just for this app. Creating one takes
about a minute, and you will not be asked again: it is saved securely on
this computer.

  1. Open this page:
     https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens
     (Sign in if you are asked to.)
  2. Choose "New access token".
  3. Describe it as something you will recognise later, such as
     "Class websites".
  4. Change the expiry — it starts at 7 days. A token that expires stops
     your publishing working, with nothing on screen to say why, so set a
     date after the end of your school year: next July is a safe choice.
     Choose "No expiration" instead if it is offered.
  5. Choose "Generate token", then copy the long code Netlify shows you —
     it is only shown once.
  6. Paste it below. Nothing appears as you paste; that is normal.

# The image tag is a hash of the build recipe, so every recipe change mints a
# new tag and orphans the previous one. Nothing used to remove them, and an
# orphan never comes back on its own: a school year of Plantoir updates would
# leave a teacher a pile of images they have never heard of, and no way to
# connect "my disk is full" to this app.
#
# Deliberately narrow, because Docker here is SHARED with other projects: only
# 'teaching-quartz:src-*' tags are ever considered, never a blanket prune, and
# any tag a container still references is left alone. Removing one of these
# costs a rebuild and not data — the recipe is bundled — so the only real risk
# is touching somebody else's image, which is what the filters are for.
#
# The build cache is deliberately NOT touched: 'docker builder prune' is global
# with no per-project filter, so it would throw away other projects' cache too.
# Clearing that stays a by-hand job.

    # two — long enough for a build finishing in ANOTHER folder to delete the
    # image it is about to start. It also stops two folders on different
    # recipes from deleting each other's image on every switch, which would
    # cost a multi-minute, network-dependent rebuild each time.
    # Docker's own age column decides this, and deliberately so. The obvious
    # alternative — inspect '{{.Created}}' and compare timestamps — is a trap:
    # that field comes back in LOCAL time WITH an offset ("...T14:17:14-04:00"),
    # not the UTC "...Z" it looks like, so comparing it against a UTC cutoff is
    # silently wrong by the offset, in whichever direction the machine sits
    # from Greenwich. ('docker images --filter since=' is no help either — it
    # takes an image NAME, not a duration; the duration filters belong to
    # 'docker image prune', the blanket command this must never use.)

    # Anything still measured in hours or minutes is left alone. Docker says
    # "N hours ago" up to 48 hours, so the guard is at least one day and in
