/// A course can publish to more than one destination now (redundancy against
/// one host having a bad day) — see
/// <see cref="CourseConfiguration.AllDeployDestinations"/>. The functions
/// here that take a single <c>destination</c> are the ones a multi-destination
/// deploy calls once per leg; the ones that take a whole
/// <c>CourseConfiguration</c> are thin wrappers over those, kept so every
/// existing caller and existing test — all written against "this course's
/// ONE destination" — keeps working unchanged, reading <c>DeployTarget</c> as
/// that one destination. Mirrors the mac's `DeployCommand.swift`.
