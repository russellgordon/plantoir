"""
Reading the Plantoir contract from Python.

`contracts/` has always been the one home for a rule both apps must agree on,
run as data by the macOS and Windows test suites. Until now nothing under
`scripts/` could read it, so a rule that ALSO lives in the Python — and the
rules about which folders carry meaning all do, because `build_site.py` is
what actually decides what ships — existed as a third implementation with no
gate on it. That is the drift the contract exists to prevent, arriving by the
back door.

**Where the files come from.** `toolchain_paths.CONTRACTS_DIR`, which is
`/opt/contracts` in the container and the app's bundled copy when Windows runs
these scripts natively. The container's ONLY bind mount is `courses`, so the
working folder's `.toolchain/` cannot be read from in here and neither can the
app bundle — the contract has to be baked into the image. That is why the
Dockerfile copies it, and why a contract edit changes the image hash and
forces a rebuild: accepted deliberately, because the alternative is a rule the
container cannot see.

**Reading is deliberately strict.** A missing or malformed contract raises
rather than falling back to a built-in default. A silent fallback would mean a
build quietly using a rule nobody could see, which is exactly the failure mode
this module was written to close. Callers that must survive a missing contract
say so explicitly with `optional=True`.
