/// <summary>
/// One run of the real Plantoir, with a working folder and a state directory
/// of its own, driven through UI Automation and torn down afterwards.
///
/// <para><b>Nothing here touches the teacher's own state.</b> The app is
/// launched with <c>--state-dir</c>, which moves its ENTIRE Plantoir folder —
/// settings, the breadcrumb trail, the startup log, scheduled-deploy
/// sentinels, models, built sites — into a temporary folder deleted at the
/// end. The working folder is built from scratch, not borrowed.</para>
///
/// <para>The one thing that made this more than tidiness: the app consumes
/// pending scheduled-deploy sentinels on launch AND on every activation, and
/// applying one writes publish state into the course folder the sentinel
/// names — an absolute path to a REAL course. An earlier version redirected
/// only settings and the trail, so a test run could have marked a teacher's
/// section as published and put the line explaining it in the redirected
/// trail, where nobody would ever look.</para>
///
/// <para>Still NOT isolated, so nobody assumes otherwise: Credential Manager,
/// and anything a CHILD process resolves for itself. The LAUNCHERS are the sharp edge and are worth
/// naming separately: <c>preview.ps1</c> and <c>deploy.ps1</c> compute the
/// builds root from the environment themselves, and the scheduled-task
/// wrapper bakes the same into the script it registers. So a redirected run
/// that PREVIEWED would look for its build where the launcher did not put it,
/// and one that SCHEDULED a deploy would register a REAL Task Scheduler task
/// whose sentinels land in the teacher's real pending folder. Nothing in the
/// suite does either today — but a UI test that drives Preview is the obvious
/// next thing somebody writes.
/// None of it is reached by a Course Settings test.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A running Plantoir is closed, not worked around.</b> Russell's
/// standing instruction (2026-09-06, and CLAUDE.md's Windows setup notes):
/// stopping to ask every time is a hassle, and it is his own development copy
/// with no unsaved state of its own. The one obligation that comes with it is
/// to SAY so — <c>run-ui-tests.ps1</c> prints it, and so does the runner's
/// output — so nobody is left wondering where their window went.</para>
