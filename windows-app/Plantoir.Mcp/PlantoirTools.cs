/// <summary>
/// The tools an assistant may call.
///
/// Four rules shape this surface. The first three are measured (research/ai-assist/HISTORY.md
/// has the numbers); the fourth came from watching a real teacher use it.
///
/// 1. **Nothing destructive exists.** No delete, no archive, no rename. In
///    testing the model reliably declined "delete the Unit 1 folder" — not
///    from judgement, but because it had no tool for it. Absence is the
///    strongest guardrail available, so it is the one relied on.
///
/// 2. **Publishing and unpublishing are separate tools, not a flag.** The one
///    genuinely dangerous failure observed was polarity inversion: asked to
///    HIDE a page, the model called publish with "include everything it links
///    to" set. A boolean is a coin flip under pressure; a verb is not.
///
/// 3. **Every write has a matching plan_ tool that changes nothing**, and the
///    plan is written to be read aloud to the teacher.
///
/// 4. **The write tools take a LIST, and take any page.** Single-page tools
///    turned one logical change into 26 deploys, and could not express "hide
///    these classes but leave the safety contract up" at all — a shared page
///    linked from both a protected class and a unpublished one is the normal shape
///    of a course.
///
/// Instance methods get a fresh instance per call, so the workspace comes from
/// the injected singleton rather than any state kept here.
