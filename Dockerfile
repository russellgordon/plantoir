# PINNED, and python-frontmatter's own PyYAML is pinned with it, because
# whether a teacher's page reaches their students is decided by what PyYAML
# makes of the line they typed. `publish: no` hides a page ONLY because PyYAML
# reads YAML 1.1's spellings of no as the boolean false; PyYAML 7 is expected
# to move to YAML 1.2, where `no` is the string "no" and that same page would
# be published. Both apps and `contracts/file-formats.json` ->
# `pageVisibility.readingCases` now state the 1.1 table as fact, so an
# unpinned upgrade would flip real pages in a teacher's course with nothing
# failing anywhere. These are the versions the image already had on
# 2026-09-18, read off `pip freeze` rather than chosen — so the pin changes
# nothing about what is installed today.

# Cloudflare's own deploy CLI, used by deploy.py for the Pages publishing
# target. It is pinned, and deliberately pinned BELOW 4.100: from 4.100 on,
# wrangler requires Node 22, while this image ships Node 20 because that is
# what Quartz v4.5.0 is known-good against. Raising Node to satisfy a newer
# CLI would mean revalidating every teacher's site build, which is a far
# larger risk than staying on the newest Node-20 wrangler. The exact pin also
# keeps the image reproducible and stops an upstream CLI change from breaking
# publishing for a teacher mid-semester.

# Bake the Explorer's hide filter into the image.
#
# The filter — a `filterFn` carrying the CQ4T-OMIT-ANCHOR marker — is what
# makes a teacher's hidden pages actually hidden. `build_site.py` can only
# rewrite the CONTENTS of the `omit` Set inside it; it cannot create the
# filter. And `/opt/quartz` is the scaffold every section's site is copied
# from, so if the filter is not here, it is not in the built site either.
#
# It used to be established only by `setup_course.py` patching the RUNNING
# container at course-creation time. That made it container state rather than
# image state, and any container recreation — which is the documented
# behaviour whenever the recipe hash changes, i.e. after most toolchain
# updates — silently threw it away. The next build then published every page
# the teacher had hidden: Private Notes, Curriculum, Learning Goals. Baking it
# here means a container has it from birth, and setup's identical patch
# becomes a harmless no-op instead of the only source of truth.
#
# Same function, imported rather than copied, so the two cannot drift.
