"""Every phrasing the assistant window offers, word for word, against the
shipped 13-tool surface — with the app's own system prompt AND its dateline.

The dateline is the part a first attempt at this got wrong, and the mistake is
worth keeping: measured WITHOUT it, "Publish the class on Monday" resolved to a
date a month away in all ten trials, and the card was nearly dropped for a
fault that belonged to the harness. `AssistAgent.say` appends
`AssistAgent.dateline()` to the user message; a probe that leaves it off is not
measuring the shipping configuration.

 "After a change, Plantoir opens the preview by itself so the teacher can look it over. "

 "the change in front of students immediately and that reviewing the preview first is the "
 "safer order — then do as they decide.")

# The third column is a HAND COPY and it goes stale, which is why nothing is
# scored off it: it only LABELS the output, and every phrasing here is probed
# either way — `[code] … probed anyway, to record what would happen if it
# were`. It was corrected on 2026-09-19 for two phrasings at once, both of
# which had become code-answered without this list being touched: "Deploy at
# 6:30 AM" with issue #168 (it had already been wrong for a day), and
# "Unpublish Unit 2, Day 3" with issue #215, where "hide" and "unpublish"
# became one frame that takes a class page as well as a whole unit.
# `trimmed-surface-suite.py` reads the answer from `contracts/assist-cases.json`
# instead, and checks its reading against the contract's own rows before it
# measures anything; that is the arrangement to copy if this column ever
# starts deciding something.
