/// <summary>

/// — one sentence, no paths, no counts they did not ask for.
/// <see cref="Detail"/> is what goes back to the model, and can be as long as
/// the answer needs to be.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> Until it did, a Windows tool returned ONE
/// string and it was shown to the teacher and fed to the model both. So "read
/// Unit 2, Day 3" put the page's entire Markdown in the chat, "what pages are
/// in this section" put sixty file paths there, and a plan ended with "Show
/// this to the teacher and ask before going ahead" — a sentence addressed to
/// the model, read by the teacher. macOS has never done that: its
/// <c>AssistToolOutcome</c> has carried the two apart since the assistant
/// shipped, which is the whole reason its replies are short. This is that
/// type, in C#.</para>
///
/// <para><b>How the summary travels.</b> The tools run in
/// <c>plantoir-mcp</c>, a separate process, and MCP has one text channel. The
/// summary rides in the result's <c>_meta</c> — the protocol's own extension
/// slot — under <see cref="TeacherSummaryKey"/>. The text content is left
/// exactly as it was, so Claude Code, which reads the detail and writes its
/// own summary, sees no change at all. A tool that says the same thing to
/// both audiences sends no <c>_meta</c>, and the absence IS the answer:
/// <see cref="Same"/> is what a client builds when nothing is there.</para>
/// </summary>
/// <param name="Summary">One line for the transcript, in the teacher's language.</param>
/// <param name="Detail">What the model is told, at whatever length it needs.</param>

/// Whether this really IS a plan — something that WOULD happen if the teacher
/// agreed.
///
/// A <c>plan_</c> tool can come back with a refusal instead: the page was not
/// found, the section does not exist. Those must not be shown with "Shall I go
/// ahead?" and two buttons underneath, which asks a teacher to approve an
/// explanation of why nothing can be done — and in the mac transcript that
/// prompted the rule, four times in a row.
