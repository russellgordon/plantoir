Which processes belong to a section's preview — run against the SHARED contract.

The cases are deserialised from `contracts/shared-rules.json` -> stopPreview,
never retyped. That is the whole point of this file's existence in its current
form: the version before it re-implemented the matching rule as a local
`would_stop()` helper and ran THAT, so it could not have caught the drift it
was written to catch. It even carried a test called "section 1 does not match
section 10" while the platform that had the bug went on having it.

Pure stdlib and no container: `stop_preview` imports nothing that is not in
the standard library, so unlike `test_graded_folders.py` this runs on the host.
