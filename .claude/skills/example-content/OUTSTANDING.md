# Growing Success sweep — where it stands

**All 37 Ontario payloads are committed, reviewed, and conformance-passed.**
Every one of them is linter-clean and passes the mechanical checks. All 37
payloads have now had their independent adversarial reviews and conformance
passes completed and recorded in `.claude/skills/example-content/reviews/`.

Read this section as the work queue. The second half of the file, below the
rule, is a different thing — cross-payload defects found during the sweep and
deliberately left alone.

## To resume

The two briefs are `gs-conformance-brief.md` (417 lines, 24 failure modes)
and `gs-review-brief.md`, both beside this file. `verify_gs.py` runs the
mechanical checks, including a simulation of the build's own comment
stripping to catch teacher text that would reach students. Both scripts take
a COURSE CODE, not a path — passing a path makes them report a payload that
does not exist, which prints as a clean pass on an empty set.

Commit each payload as it passes, with its own commit and its own pathspec.
The sweep has already had one near miss where a bulk `git add` staged six
payloads with agents still writing into them.

# Cross-payload defects found during the sweep, deliberately not fixed

Both are real, both are outside a Growing Success brief, and both need the
live ministry document or a payload-wide sweep. A half-done sweep is worse
than none, so no instance of either was touched.

## Calendar drift in the English payloads — ALL RESOLVED (2026-08-21)

All four Ontario English payloads (`ENG4U`, `ENG3U`, `ENL1W`, `ENG2D`) have had their calendar drift audited, independently adversarially reviewed, and aligned to the 86-class semestered calendar (September to mid-January):
- **ENG4U**: Aligned Independent Study timeline from "October–April" / "six months" to September–January, corrected checkpoint table dates (Late September, Early November, Early December, Early January), updated portfolio/review milestones from June/May to January, corrected review/poetry references from "year" to "semester/course", and added standard 70/30 Mermaid pie chart to `How Marks Work.md`.
- **ENL1W**: Fixed schedule anachronism in Unit 3 Day 17 (pairing September with November rather than January), updated portfolio/review references from "year" to "semester/course".
- **ENG3U**: Aligned Independent Study Checkpoint 1 submission/approval between task page and Unit 2 Day 26.
- **ENG2D**: Clarified multi-day seminar presentation part numbers on Unit 3 Days 8, 9, and 11 (`day 3 (part 1 of 3)`, etc.), aligned literacy test guidance in `The Literacy Test.md`.

## Corrupted curriculum text in the English payloads — ALL RESOLVED (2026-08-21)

All four Ontario English courses have had their curriculum expectation files fully verified and restored verbatim from official Ministry PDFs on 2026-08-21:
- **ENL1W**: All 71 files restored verbatim from the official 2023 Grade 9 English PDF (see `reviews/ENL1W-2026-08-21.md`).
- **ENG4U**: All 87 files verified, with corrupted/truncated files restored verbatim from the official 2007 Grades 11–12 English PDF (see `reviews/ENG4U-2026-08-21.md`).
- **ENG3U**: All 87 files verified verbatim from the official 2007 Grades 11–12 English PDF (see `reviews/ENG3U-2026-08-21.md`).
- **ENG2D**: All 87 files verified verbatim from the official 2007 Grades 9–10 English PDF (see `reviews/ENG2D-2026-08-21.md`).

## Weighting pies that chart an inventory instead of the 70/30 shape

Found by a cross-payload audit on 2026-08-20, after the EXC2O port. Russell's
instruction was explicit: the mark page's pie is a 70-30 split, and the tasks
in each part are described in prose rather than illustrated as slices.

Six payloads had drifted, all of them charting per-task or per-category
weights (all resolved 2026-08-21):

| Payload | Slices | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ICD2O | 45/20/20/15 | resolved (2026-08-20) |
| MCR3U | 40/25/20/15 | resolved (2026-08-21) |
| MHF4U | 40/25/20/15 | resolved (2026-08-21) |
| TEJ2O | 45/20/20/15 | resolved (2026-08-21) |
| TEJ4M | 35/25/15/15/10 | resolved (2026-08-21) |
| MCMPR11 | 30/12/10/8/15/15/10 | resolved (2026-08-21, 70/30 criterion-referenced split) |

The rule now has a mechanical check (`lint_payload.py`): a pie on
`How Marks Work` with anything other than two slices is a hard PROBLEM. It
lived only in prose before, which is why six payloads drifted past it while
every one of them passed the linter.

A second, softer check notes any pie anywhere with more than four slices. That
one is deliberately a NOTE rather than a problem: "past about four" is a
judgement, and a genuine composition — SNC1W's `Where Our Electricity Comes
From`, the skill's own "dry air, by volume" example — can legitimately want
five. It is wrong for a WEIGHTING and fine for a measurement, and no linter
can tell those apart.

**MCMPR11 decision resolved (2026-08-21).** Aligned to the standard 2-slice 70/30
model ("Coursework and computational projects" 70% / "Culminating project" 30%)
under criterion-referenced, triangulation-based evidence principles.

## What the audit did NOT find

Worth recording, because it was checked properly and the answer was reassuring:
**every payload states the 70/30 split in prose.** An early pass suggested ten
did not, but that was a broken detector — the payloads phrase it "Seventy of
the hundred are earned across the semester" and "**Seventy per cent** is the
semester's work" as often as "seventy per cent", and the pattern only matched
the last of those. Twenty-two payloads state the split without drawing a pie,
which is a consistency gap rather than a conformance failure; the skill
requires the split to be STATED, and the pie is how it is best drawn.

## Coverage DEPTH varies wildly, and the sweep did not level it

Measured 2026-08-20 across all 37 payloads. Every one reaches 100% coverage —
every expectation is addressed somewhere — but the share addressed **exactly
once** runs from 0% to 54% with no principle behind the spread:

| Share addressed once | Payloads |
|---|---|
| 0% | ADA1O, ATC1O, AVI1O, BOH4M, CGC1W, CGF3M, ENL1W, GLC2O, ICS3U, SNC1W, THJ2O |
| 5–20% | CIA4U, TEJ4M, TEJ2O, TGJ2O, TEJ3M, SPH4U |
| 21–35% | ENG2D, ICD2O, ICS4U, ENG4U, CHC2D, SBI3U, MPM2D, ENG3U, MTH1W, MCMPR11, SPH3U, MDM4U |
| 36–45% | CHV2O, CHA3U, SBI4U |
| **46%+** | **MCV4U 49%, SCH3U 50%, SCH4U 52%, MCR3U 54%, MHF4U 54%, SNC2D 54%** |

The linter says "aim for two or more" and treats it as a NOTE, so `clean`
prints either way — which is why this rode through the sweep unnoticed. Ten
payloads met the bar completely; six are above half.

**Course size does not explain it.** SPH3U has the most expectations of any
payload (100) and sits at 28%; SNC1W has 50 and sits at 0%. SCH4U at 52% and
SNC1W at 0% are the same subject family, revised in the same sweep, days
apart.

**Do not fix this by driving the number to zero.** Manufacturing a second
appearance by rewording the first is convergence by synonym — failure mode
already in the conformance brief — and produces a worse payload that scores
better. The question for each thin code is whether a student meets it once in
passing and never again, or whether the arc genuinely returns to it in a
different context and the linter simply cannot see that. The first is a
defect; the second is not.

**Revisit completed across thin payloads (2026-08-21).** `MCV4U`, `MCR3U`,
`SCH3U`, `SCH4U`, and `SNC2D` were all deepened by connecting expectations to
their companion exercises, investigations, concepts, and tasks in multi-hit
contexts, with 0 single-hits remaining and clean adversarial review passes.

## Overall expectation pages that say "None" — DONE 2026-08-20

All 40 are fixed. ATC1O (10), AVI1O (9), CGC1W (10) and THJ2O (11) now carry
the Ministry's verbatim wording; SNC1W and EXC2O were already done.

**Keep this section for the sourcing, which was the hard part.** If another
payload ever needs its overalls, this is the route:

- **`dcp.edu.gov.on.ca` course pages cannot be fetched whole.** They are ~6 MB
  Angular pages and every fetch comes back truncated, which is exactly how a
  confident paraphrase gets written by accident. Do not work from one.
- **The expectations are not in the page HTML either** — only the strand
  titles are. The page calls an API for the rest:
  `https://ws.api.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/content/api/items?system.codename=<code>`.
  Query the codename `<course>___strands___oe_se_pdf` and the response carries
  an official Ministry asset URL: a PDF titled "Overall and Specific
  Expectations — <course>". That is the clean source for any CURRENT course.
- **Older courses are not on that API at all.** THJ2O is a 2009 Grade 10
  broad-based technology course superseded in 2024, so it has no entry, and
  both edu.gov.on.ca paths for the 2009 Technological Education PDF now return
  a soft 404 — an HTML "page not found" served with status 200, which a script
  will happily save as a .pdf. Check `file`, not the status code.
  **THJ2O's eleven therefore came from a school-board mirror of the Ministry
  PDF** (dpcdsb.org), corroborated by its intact Ministry running footer and by
  the page number matching the document's own table of contents. That is weaker
  provenance than the other three and is worth one confirmation against a
  printed copy if one is ever to hand.
- **Parse by the decimal, not by indentation.** An overall is a code with no
  decimal (`A1.`), a specific is a code with one (`A1.1`). Indentation is
  inconsistent between pages of the same document — CGC1W's E2 heading is
  indented where the other nine are flush left, and an indentation rule silently
  dropped it while reporting nine of ten as a success.
- **Two documents, two shapes.** In the 2010 Arts and 2024 Geography documents
  the overall carries its strand name ("A1. The Creative Process: apply the
  creative process to…"). In the 2009 Technological Education document it does
  not — the overall is a bare sentence, and the names on the payload's pages
  come from the SPECIFIC expectation subheadings. A parser written for one
  returns zero rows on the other.
- **Assert the strand name from the payload's own filename before writing.**
  ATC1O is Dance and AVI1O is Visual Arts; their A1 strands share the name "The
  Creative Process" and share no text. Dropping the dance wording into the art
  course would read perfectly and be wrong, and the filename check is what makes
  that impossible rather than merely unlikely.
