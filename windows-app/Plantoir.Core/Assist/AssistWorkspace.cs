/// chose the publish tool and silently skipped the link resolution, eight
/// times out of eight. Given one coarse tool that resolves links itself, it
/// got it right eight times out of eight. So link resolution, the choice

            This is the shape every class page takes: a numbered agenda of what
            happened, with links to the pages it used, then a short list of things
            to do before next time. Nothing is explained here — the links do that.

            {plural} created for you, dated to the days this class actually meets.
            Rename them, add more, delete the ones you do not need. The `created:`
            date is what puts them in order under All Classes, so a new page needs
            one of its own.

            This page is unpublished. Write it, then publish it when it is ready.
            Delete this comment when you do — comments never reach the site either.
