/// invites a teacher to get creative with it, and turns an implementation
/// detail into a promise the product then has to keep. Saying "your
/// expectations live in Ontario Curriculum" tells them the thing they can act
/// on. It is also why the sheet is per-COURSE rather than one static help
/// page: the answers genuinely differ. One course grades "Tasks", another
/// "Tests" and "Thinking Tasks"; one calls its class folder "All Classes",
/// another "Lessons".</para>
