/// scheduled-deploy wrappers and their finished sentinels each used to
/// compute that path for themselves. Redirecting a run therefore meant
/// remembering all of them, and the first attempt redirected two — which left
/// a UI test consuming the teacher's REAL pending scheduled-deploy sentinels
/// on launch and writing publish state into their REAL course folders, while
/// the trail line explaining it went to the redirected trail where nobody
/// would look. An isolation you have to remember to extend is one that leaks
/// at the next thing somebody adds.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Redirecting %LOCALAPPDATA% itself does not work</b>, and was tried

/// and ignores the environment variable entirely.</para>
///
/// <para>Set once, from <c>--state-dir</c>, before anything reads anything.
/// <b>It does NOT reach other processes.</b> The LAUNCHERS are the sharp edge and are worth
/// naming separately: <c>preview.ps1</c> and <c>deploy.ps1</c> compute the
/// builds root from the environment themselves, and the scheduled-task
/// wrapper bakes the same into the script it registers. So a redirected run
/// that PREVIEWED would look for its build where the launcher did not put it,
/// and one that SCHEDULED a deploy would register a REAL Task Scheduler task
/// whose sentinels land in the teacher's real pending folder. Nothing in the
/// suite does either today — but a UI test that drives Preview is the obvious
/// next thing somebody writes.
/// <c>plantoir-mcp.exe</c> resolves its own too.</para>
