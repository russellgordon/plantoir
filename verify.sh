# verify.sh — end-to-end verification of local toolchain changes (maintainer use)
#
# Builds a fresh local image (quartz-teacher:dev-test) from this repository,
# checks that everything baked into it matches the working tree, then drives
# the real launcher scripts against it so you can confirm that host-side and
# image-side changes work together — the same recipe every working
# folder builds from locally.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   0. Runs the shared scripts' pure-Python unit tests (no Docker needed) so a
#      broken script fails in milliseconds rather than after a full image
#      build. Step 0 also RUNS deploy.sh AND preview.sh — hollowed out with
#      --image and a Keychain user that does not exist, so they need no
#      container, no network and no credentials — because a launcher that is
#      only ever read is a launcher nobody has started (GitHub issues #129 and
#      #124). Note that these tests are a written LIST here, not a discovery:
#      a new scripts/test_*.py must be added below or it runs on Windows (whose
#      PythonToolchainTests does discover them) and nowhere on the mac.
#   1. Ensures the container runtime is up (shares an already-running Colima;
#      never stops it — safe to run alongside other Colima-based toolchains).
#   2. docker build -t quartz-teacher:dev-test .
#   3. Verifies 'export-scripts' emits launchers identical to the repo copies
#      (and that Windows launchers were converted to CRLF).
#   4. Verifies the Python scripts and Quartz patches baked into the image
#      match the working tree.
#   5. Removes this folder's existing container, then runs
#      ./preview.sh EXC2O 1 --image quartz-teacher:dev-test --full-rebuild --build-only
#      so the container is recreated FROM THE DEV-TEST IMAGE and a full static
#      build of the Example Course runs through the real launcher.
#   6. Confirms the built site exists, that it carries and links Plantoir's
#      own icon rather than Quartz's, and that the running container uses the
#      dev-test image, then prints a PASS/FAIL summary.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify.sh [--no-cache] [--skip-build]
#
#   --no-cache     Build the image without Docker's layer cache.
#   --skip-build   Reuse an existing quartz-teacher:dev-test image (faster when
#                  only host-side scripts changed).
#
# Requires: courses/EXC2O (the Example Course) in this folder as the build
# fixture. courses/ is gitignored, so on a fresh clone install it first via
# ./setup.sh (answer 'y' to the Example Course prompt).

# any container recreation silently published Private Notes, Curriculum and
# Learning Goals. Asserted against the IMAGE on purpose: a check that ran in a
# long-lived container would have passed throughout the whole time this was
# broken.
#
# Structural, not a bare substring grep (tightened 2026-08-23 after an
# adversarial review of this fix): the marker comment proves nothing on its
# own if it has drifted away from the `omit` Set it documents — a file can
# contain the literal string CQ4T-OMIT-ANCHOR while nothing wires the hidden
# list into `filterFn`. `-Pzo` treats the whole file as one NUL-terminated
# record so the match can span the single newline between the marker's own
# line and the `const omit =` line it must sit directly above — deliberately
# NOT `.` matching across arbitrary further lines, which would let an anchor
# "match" a Set pages of unrelated code away and defeat the point of asking.
# The same adjacency `build_site.py`'s `_anchor_is_structurally_wired` now
# requires — read that function's comment before touching either.
