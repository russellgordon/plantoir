/// The twenty-two tools that exist — thirteen of them shown to the local
/// model — and what running one does.
///
/// Four rules shape this surface. They are inherited from the Windows work
/// rather than rediscovered, and every one of them is measured:
///
/// 1. **Nothing destructive exists.** No delete, no rename, no archive. In
///    testing the model reliably declined "delete the Unit 1 folder" — not from
///    judgement, but because it had no tool for it. Absence is the strongest
///    guardrail available, so it is the one relied on.
///
/// 2. **Publishing and unpublishing are separate tools, not a flag.** The one
///    genuinely dangerous failure ever observed was polarity inversion: asked
///    to HIDE a page, the model called publish with "include everything it
///    links to" set. A boolean is a coin flip under pressure; a verb is not. So
///    the verb is in the tool NAME, it is fixed at the point the tool is
///    routed, and it is carried by the plan all the way to the write — there is
///    no argument anywhere on this surface that could invert it. That boolean
///    is gone entirely now: how far each verb reaches is `AssistPublishPlanner`'s
///    rule, and no tool anywhere takes a boolean.
///
/// 3. **Every write that changes a page has a matching `plan_` tool that
///    changes nothing**, and the plan is written to be read aloud.
///
/// 4. **The coarse tools resolve their own links.** Given `resolve_links`,
///    `set_publish` and `publish_section` separately and asked to publish
///    tomorrow's class and everything it links to, the model chose
///    `publish_section` 8 times out of 8 — consistent, and wrong. Given one
///    `publish_class_on` that follows the links itself, it was right 8 out of
///    8.
///
/// Approval is declared by the tool, not kept in a list here. Only deploying
/// asks for a button: publishing is backed up and `undo_last_change` takes it
/// back, and a gate in front of every write teaches a teacher to click through
/// gates, which is worse than having no gate at all.
///
/// Observable for one property's sake: `conversationBackupURL` appears part way
/// through a conversation, the moment the first write saves a copy, and the
/// window's Restore banner has to appear with it rather than at whatever redraw
/// happens along next.
