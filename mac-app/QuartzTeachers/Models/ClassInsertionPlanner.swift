/// pointed at a page whose name has just changed — across a course that might
/// hold two hundred pages.
///
/// Two separate things happen, and the plan keeps them apart because they read
/// differently to a teacher:
///
/// * Later days of the SAME unit are **renamed** — Day 3 becomes Day 4.
/// * Every class from the insertion point onwards, later units included,
///   **moves to a later meeting day and keeps its name**. A later unit's Day 1
///   is still its Day 1; it simply happens later in the year.
///
/// This is also the most dangerous thing here, because it renames pages the
/// teacher's links point at. So the plan names the renames, counts the links
/// and says how the dates move, before anything happens at all.
